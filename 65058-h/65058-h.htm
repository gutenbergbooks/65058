<h2 class="packed" title="INTRODUCTION" id="Introduction">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class="sp1">§ 1. We hear it often repeated that human nature is
the same at all times and in all places; and this is urged at
times and places where it is so manifestly false that we
feel disposed peremptorily to deny it when paraded to us
as a general truth. The fact is that only in its lower
activities does human nature show any remarkable uniformity;
so far as men are mere animals, they have strong
resemblances, and in savages even their minds seem to
originate the same fancies in various ages and climes. But
when we come to higher developments, to the spiritual
element in individuals, to the social and political relations
of civilized men, the pretended truism gives way more and
more to the opposite truth, that mankind varies at all
times and in all places. As no two individuals, when carefully
examined, are exactly alike, so no two societies of
men are even nearly alike; and at the present time there
is probably no more fertile cause of political and legislative
blundering than the assumption that the constitution successfully
worked out by one people can be transferred by
the force of a mere decree to its neighbors. All the recent
experiments in state-reform have been based on this assumption,
as if the transferrence of a House of Commons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 2</span>
in any real sense were not as impossible as the transferrence
of Eton and of Oxford to some foreign society.</p>

<p>Although, therefore, we cannot deny that past history
contains many fruitful lessons for the bettering of our
own time, it is not unlikely that the tendency of the present
widely informed but hasty age is to exaggerate the
likenesses of various epochs, and to overrate the force of
analogy in social and political reasoning. Historical parallels
are generally striking only up to a certain point; a
deeper knowledge discloses elements of contrast, wide differences
of motive, great variations in human feeling.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 2. But as we go back to simpler states of life, or
earlier stages of development, the argument from analogy
becomes stronger, and the lessons we may derive from
history, though less striking, are more trustworthy. This
is peculiarly the case with the problem of education as
handled by civilized nations in various ages. The material
to be worked upon is that simpler and fresher human nature,
in which varieties are due only to heredity, and not
yet to the numerous artificial stimulants and restraints
which every society of mature men invents for itself. The
games and sports of children, all over the world, are as
uniform as the weapons and designs of savages. The delights
and disappointments of education have also remained
the same, at least in many respects. The conflict of theoretical
and practical educators, and the failure of splendid
schemes for the reform of society by a systematic training
of youth, mark every over-ripe civilization. Here, then, if
anywhere, we may gain a distinct advantage by contemplating
the problems, which we ourselves are solving, under
discussion in a remote society. The more important and
permanent elements will stand out clearer when freed from
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 3</span> interests and prejudices of our own day, and from the
necessities of our own situation; and thus we may be
taught to regain freedom of judgment and escape from the
iron despotism of a traditional system. For if it be the
case that in no department of our life are we more thoroughly
enslaved than on the question of education, if it
be true that we are obliged here to submit our children to
the ignorance and prejudice of nurses, governesses, priests,
pedants—all following more or less stupid traditions, and
all coerced by shackles which they want either the knowledge
or the power to break—then any inquiry which may
lead us to consider freely and calmly what is right and
what is not right, what is possible and what is not possible,
in education cannot but have real value, apart from purely
historical or learned considerations.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 3. In fact, the main object of this book is to interest
men who are not classical scholars, and who are not professional
educators, in the theory of education as treated
by that people which is known to have done more than
any other in fitting its members for the higher ends and
enjoyments of life. The Greeks were far behind us in the
mechanical aids to human progress; they understood not
the use of electricity, or of steam, or of gunpowder, or of
printing. But, in spite of this, the Greek public was far
better educated than we are—nay, to some extent, because
of this it was better educated. For Greek life afforded
proper leisure for thorough intellectual training, and this
includes first of all such political training as is strange to
almost the whole of Europe; secondly, moral training of
so high a kind as to rival at times the light of revelation;
thirdly, social training to something higher than music and
feasting by way of recreation; and, fourthly, artistic training,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 4</span>
which, while it did not condescend to bad imitations
of great artists, taught the public to understand and to
love true and noble ideals.</p>

<p>Why must these great ends of education be obscured
or lost by the modern wonders of discovery, which should
make them more easy of attainment and wider in circulation?
Were the Greeks better off in education than we
are, and, if so, why were they better off? or is all this alleged
Greek superiority an idle dream of the pedants, with
no solid basis in facts? If it is real, can we not discover
the secret of their superiority, and use it with far wider and
deeper effect in our Christian society? or is human nature
of narrow and fixed capacity, and does the addition of wide
ranges of positive science and of various tongues mar irrevocably
the cultivation of the pure reason and of the æsthetic
faculty? These are the problems which will occupy
the following pages, not in their abstract form; they will
be considered in close relation to the success or failure of
the old Greeks in discussing and solving them.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 4. There have been only two earlier nations and one
later which could compete with the Greeks in their treatment
of this perpetual problem in human progress. We
have first the Egyptian nation, which by its thorough and
widely diffused culture attained a duration of national prosperity
and happiness perhaps never since equalled. Isolated
from other civilized races by geographical position, by language,
and in consequence by social institutions, the Egyptians
prosecuted internal development more assiduously
than is the wont of mere conquering races. The few
foreign possessions acquired by the Egyptians were never
assimilated, and the civilization of the Nile remained isolated
and unique. We have reason to know that this refined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 5</span>
social life, which is perpetuated in pictures on the
monuments of the land—this large and various literature,
of which so many fragments have been recovered in our
century—was not created without a diffused and systematic
education. In Plato’s “Laws,”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the training of their young
children in elementary science is described as far superior
to anything in Greece. But, unfortunately, the materials
for any estimate of Egyptian education, in its process, are
wanting. We can see plainly its great national effects;
we have even some details as to the special training in
separate institutions of a learned and literary class; but
nothing more has yet been recovered. If we knew the
various steps by which Moses became “learned in all the
wisdom of the Egyptians,” an interesting field of comparison
would be opened to us; and here, no doubt, we should
find some of our own difficulties discussed and perhaps
solved by early sages, still more by an enlightened public
opinion, showing itself in the establishment of sound traditions.
And, no doubt, from the dense population, the
subdivision of property and of labor, and the absence of a
great territorial aristocracy, the education of the Egyptians
must have corresponded to our middle-class and primary
systems, together with special institutions for the higher
training of the professions and of the literary caste.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 5. If we could command our material, we might seek
elsewhere for analogies to the education of our nobility
and higher gentry. We know through Greek and Roman
sources, as well as through the heroic poetry of the “Shahnameh,”
that the Aryan nobles who became, under Cyrus,
the rulers of Western Asia, were in character, as they were
in blood, allied to the Germanic chiefs and Norse Vikings,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 6</span>
with their love of daring adventure, their chivalry, and
their intense loyalty to their appointed sovereign. In
these qualities they were strangely opposed to the democratic
Greeks, on whom they looked with contempt, while
they were appreciated in return only by a few such men
as Herodotus and Xenophon. Indeed, such devotion to
their sovereign as made them leap overboard to lighten
his ship in a storm was confounded by the Greeks with
slavish submission, Oriental prostrations, and other signs
of humiliation. Nevertheless, the men whom the Greeks
long dared not look in the face—the conquerors of half
the known world, the successful rivals of the Romans for
the dominion of the East—faced death under Xerxes and
the last Darius with other feelings than those of slavish
submission. Herodotus, in his interesting and sympathetic
account of them, says their children’s education consisted
of three things—to ride, to shoot, and to tell the truth.
If he had added a chivalrous loyalty to their kings like
that of the French nobles in the last century, he would
have completed the picture, and sketched a training which
many an English gentleman considers little short of perfection.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 6. The Romans are the only other ancient people who
stand near enough to us to suggest an inquiry into their
education. And it may be said that they combined the
dignity of noble traditions with the practical instincts of
a successful trading people. Hence Roman education, if
carried on with system, ought of all others to correspond
with that of Englishmen, who should combine the same
qualities in carrying out an analogous policy, and in filling,
to some extent, a similar position in the world. But so
closely was all Roman culture based on Greek books and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 7</span>
models that, although every people must develop individual
features of its own—and the Romans had plenty of
them, as we may see from Quintilian—any philosophical
knowledge of Roman education must depend upon a previous
knowledge of the Greeks. In many respects the Romans
were a race more congenial to the English, and hence
by us more easily understood. In the coarser and stronger
elements of human character, in directness and love of
truth, in a certain contempt of æsthetics and of speculation,
in a blunt assertion of the supremacy of practical
questions, in a want of sympathy, and often a stupid ignorance
and neglect of the character and requirements of
subject races, the Romans are the true forerunners of the
English in history. Burdened as we are with these defects
of national character, the products of the subtler and more
genial, if less solid and truthful, Hellenic race are particularly
well worth our consideration. This has been so
thoroughly recognized by thoughtful men in our generation
as to require no further support by argument. It
only remains that each of our Hellenists should do his best,
in some distinct line, to make the life of the Greeks known
to us with fairness and accuracy.</p>

<span class="fs75">INFANCY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>§ 7. We find in Homer, especially in the “Iliad,” indications
of the plainest kind that Greek babies were like the
babies of modern Europe, equally troublesome, equally delightful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 8</span>
to their parents, equally uninteresting to the rest
of society. The famous scene in the sixth book of the
“Iliad,” when Hector’s infant, Astyanax, screams at the sight
of his father’s waving crest, and the hero lays his helmet
on the ground that he may laugh and weep over the child;
the love and tenderness of Andromache, and her pathetic
laments in the twenty-second book—are familiar to all.
She foresees the hardships and unkindnesses to her orphan
boy, “who was wont upon his father’s knees to eat the
purest marrow and the rich fat of sheep; and when sleep
came upon him, and he ceased his childish play, he would
lie in the arms of his nurse, on a soft cushion, satisfied
with every comfort.” So, again,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> a protecting goddess is
compared to a mother keeping the flies from her sleeping
infant, and a pertinacious friend<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to a little girl who, running
beside her mother, begs to be taken up, holding her
dress and delaying her, and with tearful eyes the child
keeps looking up till the mother denies her no longer.
These are only stray references, and yet they speak no
less clearly than if we had asked for an express answer to
a direct inquiry. So we have the hesitation of the murderers
sent to make away with the infant Cypselus, who
had been foretold to portend danger to the Corinthian
Herods of that day. The smile of the baby unmans—or
should we rather say unbrutes?—the first ruffian, and so
the task is passed on from man to man. This story in
Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is a sort of natural Greek parallel to the great
Shakespearian scene, where another child sways his intended
torturer with an eloquence more conscious and explicit,
but not, perhaps, more powerful, than the radiant smile of
the Greek baby. Thus Euripides, the great master of pathos,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 9</span>
represents Iphigenia bringing her infant brother Orestes
to plead for her with that unconsciousness of sorrow
which pierces us to the heart more than the most affecting
rhetoric. In modern art a little child, playing about its
dead mother, and waiting with contentment for her awaking,
is perhaps the most powerful appeal to human compassion
which we are able to conceive.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the troubles of infancy were then as
now very great. We do not, indeed, hear of croup or
teething or measles or whooping-cough. But these are
occasional matters, and count as nothing beside the inexorable
tyranny of a sleepless baby. For then as now
mothers and nurses had a strong prejudice in favor of
carrying about restless children, and so soothing them to
sleep. The unpractical Plato requires that in his fabulous
Republic two or three stout nurses shall be in readiness to
carry about each child, because children, like game-cocks,
gain spirit and endurance by this treatment! What they
really gain is a gigantic power of torturing their mothers.
Most children can readily be taught to sleep in a bed, or
even in an arm-chair; but an infant once accustomed to being
carried about will insist upon it; and so it came that
Greek husbands were obliged to relegate their wives to another
sleeping-room, where the nightly squalling of the
furious infant might not disturb the master as well as the
mistress of the house. But the Greek gentleman was able
to make good his damaged rest by a mid-day siesta, and
so required but little sleep at night. The modern father
in Northern Europe, with his whole day’s work and waking,
is therefore in a more disadvantageous position.</p>

<p>Of course, very fashionable people kept nurses, and it
was the highest tone at Athens to have a Spartan nurse for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 10</span>
the infant, just as an English nurse is sought out among
foreign noblesse. We are told that these women made the
child hardier, that they used less swathing and bandaging,
and allowed free play for the limbs; and this, like all the
Spartan physical training, was approved of and admired
by the rest of the Greek public, though its imitation was
never suggested save in the unpractical speculations of
Plato.</p>

<p>Whether they also approved of a diet of marrow and
mutton suet, which Homer, in the passage just cited, considers
the luxury of princes, does not appear. As Homer
was the Greek Bible—an inspired book containing perfect
wisdom on all things, human and divine—there must have
been many orthodox parents who followed his prescription.
But we hear no approval or censure of such diet.
Possibly marrow may have represented our cod-liver oil
in strengthening delicate infants. But as the Homeric
men fed far more exclusively on meat than their historical
successors, some vegetable substitute, such as olive oil,
must have been in use later on. Even within our memory
mutton suet boiled in milk was commonly recommended
by physicians for the delicacy now treated by cod-liver oil.
The supposed strengthening of children by air and exposure,
or by early neglect of their comforts, was as fashionable
at Sparta as it is with many modern theorists, and
it probably led in both cases to the same result—the extinction
of the weak and delicate. These theorists parade
the cases of survival of stout children—that is, their exceptional
soundness—as the effect of this harsh treatment,
and so satisfy themselves that experience confirms their
views. Now with the Spartans this was logical enough,
for as they professed and desired nothing but physical results,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 11</span>
as they despised intellectual qualities, and esteemed
obedience to be the highest of moral ones, they were perhaps
justified in their proceeding. So thoroughly did they
advocate the production of healthy citizens for military
purposes that they were quite content that the sickly
should die. In fact, in the case of obviously weak and
deformed infants, they did not hesitate to expose them in
the most brutal sense, not to cold and draughts, but to the
wild beasts in the mountains.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 8. This brings us to the first shocking contrast between
the Greek treatment of children and ours. We cannot
really doubt, from the free use of the idea in Greek
tragedies, in the comedies of ordinary life, and in theories
of political economy, that the exposing of new-born children
was not only sanctioned by public feeling, but actually
practised throughout Greece. Various motives combined
to justify or to extenuate this practice. In the first
place, the infant was regarded as the property of its parents,
indeed of its father, to an extent inconceivable to
most modern Christians. The State only, whose claim
overrode all other considerations, had a right, for public
reasons, to interfere with the dispositions of a father. Individual
human life had not attained what may be called
the exaggerated value derived from sundry superstitions,
which remains even after those superstitions have decayed.
And, moreover, in many Greek states, the contempt for
commercial pursuits, and the want of outlet for practical
energy, made the supporting of large families cumbersome,
or the subdivision of patrimonies excessive. Hence the
prudence or the selfishness of parents did not hesitate to
use an escape which modern civilization condemns as not
only criminal, but as horribly cruel. How little even the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 12</span>
noblest Greek theorists felt this objection appears from the
fact that Plato, the Attic Moses, sanctions infanticide<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> under
certain circumstances or in another form, in his ideal
state. In the genteel comedy it is often mentioned as a
somewhat painful necessity, but enjoined by prudence.
Nowhere does the agony of the mother’s heart reach us
through their literature, save in one illustration used by the
Platonic Socrates, where he compares the anger of his pupils,
when first confuted out of their prejudices, to the fury
of a young mother deprived of her first infant. There is
something horrible in the very allusion, as if in after-life
Attic mothers became hardened to this treatment. We
must suppose the exposing of female infants to have been
not uncommon until the just retribution of barrenness fell
upon the nation, and the population dwindled away by a
strange atrophy.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 9. In the many family suits argued by the Attic orators,
we do not (I believe) find a case in which a large family
of children is concerned. Four appears a larger number
than the average. Marriages between relations as close
as uncle and niece, and even half-brothers and sisters, were
not uncommon; but the researches of modern science have
removed the grounds for believing that this practice would
tend to diminish the race. It would certainly increase any
<em>pre-existing</em> tendency to hereditary disease; yet we do not
hear of infantile diseases any more than we hear of delicate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 13</span>
infants. Plagues and epidemics were common enough,
but, as already observed, we do not hear of measles, or
whooping-cough, or scarlatina, or any of the other constant
persecutors of our nurseries.</p>

<p>As the learning of foreign languages was quite beneath
the notions of the Greek gentleman, who rather expected
all barbarians to learn <em>his</em> language, the habit of employing
foreign nurses, so useful and even necessary to good modern
education, was well-nigh unknown. It would have
been thought a great misfortune to any Hellenic child to
be brought up speaking Thracian or Egyptian. Accordingly,
foreign slave attendants, with their strange accent
and rude manners, were not allowed to take charge of
children till they were able to go to school, and had learned
their mother tongue perfectly.</p>

<p>But the women’s apartments, in which children were
kept for the first few years, are closed so completely to us
that we can but conjecture a few things about the life and
care of Greek babies. A few late epigrams tell the grief
of parents bereaved of their infants. Beyond this, classical
literature affords us no light. The backwardness in culture
of Greek women leads us to suspect that then, as now,
Greek babies were more often spoiled than is the case among
the serious Northern nations. The term “Spartan mother”
is, however, still proverbial; and, no doubt, in that exceptional
State discipline was so universal and so highly esteemed
that it penetrated even to the nursery. But in the
rest of Greece we may conceive the young child arriving
at his schoolboy age more wilful and headstrong than most
of our more watched and worried infants. Archytas, the
philosopher, earned special credit for inventing the rattle,
and saving much damage to household furniture by occupying
children with this toy.</p>

<span class="fs75">EARLIER CHILDHOOD.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="sp1">§ 10. The external circumstances determining a Greek
boy’s education were somewhat different from ours. We
must remember that all old Greek life, except in rare cases,
such as that of Elis, of which we know nothing, was distinctly
<em>town life</em>; and so, naturally, Greek schooling was day
schooling, from which the children returned to the care of
their parents. To hand over boys, far less girls, to the
charge of a boarding-school was perfectly unknown, and
would, no doubt, have been gravely censured. Orphans
were placed under the care of their nearest male relative,
even when their education was provided (as it was in some
cases) by the State. Again, as regards the age of going to
school, it would naturally be early, seeing that day schools
may well include infants of tender age, and that in Greek
households neither father nor mother was often able or
disposed to undertake the education of the children. Indeed,
we find it universal that even the knowledge of the
letters, and reading, were obtained from a schoolmaster.
All these circumstances would point to an early beginning
of Greek school life; whereas, on the other hand, the small
number of subjects required in those days, the absence
from the programme of various languages, of most exact
sciences, and of general history and geography, made it
unnecessary to begin so early, or work so hard, as our unfortunate
children have to do. Above all, there were no
competitive examinations, except in athletics and music.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 15</span>
The Greeks never thought of promoting a man for “dead
knowledge,” but for his living grasp of science or of life.</p>

<p>Owing to these causes, we find the theorists discussing,
as they now do, the expediency of waiting till the age of
seven before beginning serious education—some advising
it, others recommending easy and half-playing lessons from
an earlier period. And then, as now, we find the same
curious silence on the really important fact that the exact
number of years a child has lived is nothing to the point
in question; and that while one child may be too young at
seven to commence work, many more may be distinctly
too old.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 11. At all events, we may assume in parents the same
varieties of over-anxiety, of over-indulgence, of nervousness,
and of carelessness about their children; and so it doubtless
came to pass that there was in many cases a gap between
infancy and school-life, which was spent in playing
and doing mischief. This may be fairly inferred, not only
from such anecdotes as that of Alcibiades playing with his
fellows in the street,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> evidently without the protection of
any pædagogue, but also from the large nomenclature of
boys’ games preserved to us in the glossaries of later grammarians.</p>

<p>These games are quite distinct from the regular exercises
in the palæstra (of which we will speak presently, as forming
a regular part of education). We have only general
descriptions of them, and these either by Greek scholiasts
or by modern philologists. But, in spite of the sad want
of practical knowledge of games shown by both, the instincts
of boyhood are so uniform that we can often frame
a very distinct idea of the sort of amusement popular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 16</span>
among Greek children. For young boys, games can hardly
consist of anything else than either the practising of some
bodily dexterity, such as hopping on one foot, higher or
longer than is easy, or throwing farther with a stone; or
else some imitation of war, such as snowballing, or pulling
a rope across a line, or pursuing under fixed conditions; or,
lastly, the practice of some mechanical ingenuity, such as
whipping a top or shooting with marbles. So far as climate
or mechanical inventions have not altered our little
boys’ games, we find all these principles represented in
Greek games. There was the hobby- or cock-horse (<span title="kalamon parabênai" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κάλαμον
παραβῆναι</span>), standing or hopping on one leg (<span title="askôliazein" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσκωλιάζειν</span>),
which, as the word <span title="askos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσκός</span> implies, was attempted on a <em>skin-bottle</em>
filled with liquid and greased; blindman’s-buff
(<span title="chalkê muia" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαλκῆ μυῖα</span>), in which the boy cried, “I am hunting a
<em>bracken fly</em>,” and the rest answered, “You will not catch
it;” games of hide-and-seek, of taking and releasing prisoners,
of fool in the middle, of playing at king—in fact,
there is probably no simple child’s game now known which
was not then in use.</p>

<p>A few more details may, however, be interesting. There
was a game called <span title="kyndalismos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κυνδαλισμός</span>, in which the <span title="kyndalon" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κύνδαλον</span> was a
peg of wood with a heavy end sharpened, which boys
sought to strike into a softened place in the earth so that
it stood upright, and knocked out the peg of a rival. This
reminds us of the pegtop-splitting which still goes on in
our streets. Another, called <span title="ostrakinda" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀστρακίνδα</span>, consisted of tossing
an oyster-shell in the air, of which one side was blackened
or moistened, and called <em>night</em>, the other <em>day</em>, or sun
and rain. The boys were divided into two sides with
these names, and, according as their side of the shell turned
up, they pursued and took prisoners their adversaries. On<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 17</span>
the other hand, <span title="epostrakismos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐποστρακισμός</span> was making a <em>shell</em> skip
along the surface of water by a horizontal throw, and
winning by the greatest number of skips. <span title="Eis ômillan" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Εἰς ὤμιλλαν</span>,
though a general expression for any contest, was specially
applied to tossing a knuckle-bone or smooth stone so as to
lie in the centre of a fixed circle, and to disturb those which
were already in good positions. This was also done into
a small hole (<span title="tropa" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρόπα</span>). They seem to have shot dried beans
from their fingers as we do marbles (<span title="fryginda" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φρυγίνδα</span>). They spun
coins on their edge (<span title="chalkismos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαλκισμός</span>).</p>

<p>Here are two games not perhaps so universal nowadays.
<span title="Pentalithizein" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πενταλιθίζειν</span> was a technical word for tossing up <em>five pebbles</em>
or astragali, and receiving them so as to make them lie
on the back of the hand. <span title="Mêlolonthê" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μηλολόνθη</span>, or the <em>beetle</em> game,
consisted in flying a beetle by a long thread, and guiding
him like a kite. But by way of improvement they attached
a waxed splinter, lighted, to his tail; and this cruelty
is now practised, according to a good authority (Papasliotis),
in Greece, and has even been known to cause serious
fires.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Tops were known under various names (<span title="bembix, strombos, strobilos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βέμβιξ,
στρόμβος, στρόβιλος</span>), one of them certainly a humming-top.
So were hoops (<span title="trochoi" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τροχοί</span>).</p>

<p>Ball-playing was ancient and diffused, even among the
Homeric heroes. But as it was found very fashionable
and carefully practised by both Mexicans and Peruvians at
the time of the conquest, it is probably common to all civilized
races. We have no details left us of complicated
games with balls; and the mere throwing them up and
catching them one from the other, with some rhythmic motion,
is hardly worth all the poetic fervor shown about this
game by the Greeks. But possibly the musical and dancing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 18</span>
accompaniments were very important, in the case of
grown people, and in historical times. Pollux, however—our
main authority for most of these games—in one place<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
distinctly describes both football and handball. “The
names,” he says, “of games with balls are—<span title="episkyros, phaininda, aporrhaxis, ourania" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίσκυρος, φαινίνδα,
ἀπόῤῥαξις, οὐρανία</span>. The first is played by two even
sides, who draw a line in the centre, which they called
<span title="skyros" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σκῦρος</span>, on which they place the ball. They draw two other
lines behind each side, and those who first reach the ball
throw it (<span title="rhiptousin" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ῥίπτουσιν</span>) over the opponents, whose duty it is to
catch it and return it, until one side drives the other back
over their goal line.” Though Pollux makes no mention
of <em>kicking</em>, this game is evidently our football in substance.
He proceeds: “<span title="phaininda" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φαινίνδα</span> was called either from Phænindes,
the first discoverer, or from deceiving (<span title="phenakizein" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φενακίζειν</span>),” <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>—we
need not follow his etymologies—“and <span title="aporrhaxis" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπόῤῥαξις</span> consists
of making a ball bound off the ground, and sending
it against a wall, counting the number of the hops according
as it was returned.” And as if to make the anticipations
of our games more curiously complete, there is cited
from the history of Manuel, by the Byzantine Cinnamus
(<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1200), a clear description of the Canadian lacrosse,
a sort of hockey played with rackets: “Certain youths,
divided equally, leave in a level place, which they have before
prepared and measured, a ball made of leather, about
the size of an apple, and rush at it, as if it were a prize
lying in the middle, from their fixed starting-point (a goal).
Each of them has in his right hand a racket (<span title="rhabdon" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ῥάβδον</span>) of
suitable length ending in a sort of flat bend, the middle of
which is occupied by gut strings dried by seasoning, and
plaited together in net fashion. Each side strives to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 19</span>
the first to bring it to the opposite end of the ground
from that allotted to them. Whenever the ball is driven
by the <span title="rhabdoi" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ῥάβδοι</span> (rackets) to the end of the ground, it counts
as a victory.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Two games, which were not confined to children, and
which are not widely diffused, though they exist, among
us, are the use of <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">astragali</i>, or knuckle-bones of animals,
so cut nearly square as to serve for dice; and with these
children threw for luck, the highest throw (sixes) being accounted
the best. In later Greek art representations of
Eros and other youthful figures engaged with astragali are
frequent. It is to be feared that this game was an introduction
to dice-playing, which was so common, and so often
abused, that among the few specimens of ancient dice remaining
there are some false, and which were evidently
loaded. The other game to which I allude is the Italian
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">morra</i>, the guessing instantaneously how many fingers are
thrown up by the player and his adversary. It is surprising
how fond Southern men and boys still are of this simple
game, chiefly, however, for gambling purposes.</p>

<p>There was tossing in a blanket, walking on stilts, swinging,
leap-frog, and many other similar plays, which are ill-understood,
and worse explained, by the learned, and of no
importance to us, save as proving the general similarity of
the life of little boys then as now.</p>

<p>We know nothing about the condition of little girls of
the same age, except that they specially indulged in ball-playing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 20</span>
Like our own children, the girls probably joined,
to a lesser degree, in the boys’ games, and only so far as
they could be carried on within-doors, in the court of the
house. There are graceful representations of their swinging
and practising our <em>seesaw</em>. Dolls they had in plenty,
and doll-making (of clay) was quite a special trade at
Athens. In more than one instance we have found in
children’s graves their favorite dolls, which sorrowing parents
laid with them as a sort of keepsake in the tomb.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 12. Most unfortunately, there is hardly a word left of
the nursery rhymes and of the folk-lore, which are very much
more interesting than the physical amusements of children.
Yet we know that such popular songs existed in plenty;
we know, too, from the early fame of Æsop’s fables, from
the myths so readily invented and exquisitely told by Plato,
that here we have lost a real fund of beautiful and stimulating
children’s stories.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> And of course here, too, the general
character of such stories throughout the human race
was preserved.</p>

<span class="fs75">SCHOOL DAYS—THE PHYSICAL SIDE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="sp1">§ 13. The most striking difference between early Greek
education and ours was undoubtedly this, that the physical
development of boys was attended to in a special place
and by a special master. It was not thought sufficient for
them to play the chance games of childhood; they underwent
careful bodily training under a very fixed system,
which was determined by the athletic contests of after-life.
This feature, which excites the admiration of the
modern Germans, and has given rise to an immense literature,
is doubtless all the more essential now that the mental
training of our boys has become so much more trying;
and we can quite feel, when we look at the physical development
of ordinary foreigners, how keenly they must
envy the freedom of limb and ease of motion, not only as
we see it suggested by Greek statues, but as we have it before
us in the ordinary sporting Englishman. But it is
quite in accordance with their want of practical development,
that while they write immense books about the physical
training of the Greeks, and the possibility of imitating
it in modern education, they seem quite ignorant of
that side of English education at our public schools; and
yet there they might see in practice a physical education
in no way inferior to that described in classical authors.
I say it quite deliberately—the public-school boy, who is
trained in cricket, football, and rowing, and who in his
holidays can obtain riding, salmon-fishing, hunting, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 22</span>
shooting, enjoys a physical training which no classical days
ever equalled. The athletic part of this training is enjoyed
by all boys at our public schools, though the field sports
at home only fall to the lot of the richer or more fortunate.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 14. When we compare what the Greeks afforded to
their boys, we find it divided into two contrasted kinds of
exercise: hunting, which was practised by the Spartans
very keenly, and no doubt also by the Eleans and Arcadians,
as may be seen from Xenophon’s “Tract on [Hare]
Hunting;” and gymnastics, which in the case of boys were
carried on in the so-called palæstra, a sort of open-air gymnasium
(in our sense) kept by private individuals as a
speculation, and to which the boys were sent, as they were
to their ordinary schoolmaster.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> We find that the Spartans,
who had ample scope for hunting with dogs in the glens
and coverts of Mount Taygetus, rather despised mere exercises
of dexterity in the palæstra, just as our sportsmen
would think very little of spending hours in a gymnasium.
But those Greeks who lived in towns like Athens, and in
the midst of a thickly populated and well-cultivated country,
could not possibly obtain hunting, and therefore found
the most efficient substitute.</p>

<p>Still, we find them very far behind the English in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 23</span>
knowledge or taste for out-of-door games, such as cricket,
football, hockey, golf, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>—games which combine chance
and skill, which combine strength with dexterity, and which
intensely interest the players while keeping them in the
open air. Yachting, though there were regattas, was not
in fashion in ancient Greece. Rowing, which they could
have practised to their heart’s content, and which was of the
last importance in their naval warfare, was never thought
gentlemanly, and always consigned to slaves or hirelings.
There are, indeed, as above quoted from Pollux, descriptions
of something like football and lacrosse, but the obscurity
and rarity of any allusions to them show that they
are in no sense national games. Running races round a
short course was one of their chief exercises, but this is no
proper out-of-door game.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 15. Accordingly, the Germans, in seeking to base their
physical education on Greek lines, seem to make the capital
mistake of ignoring that kind of exercise for boys
which vastly exceeds in value any training in gymnasia.
The Eton and Harrow match at Lord’s is a far more beautiful
sight, and far better for the performers, than the boys’
wrestling or running at Olympia. And besides the variety
of exercise at a game like cricket, and the various intelligence
and decision which it stimulates, a great part of the
game lies not in the winning, but in the proper <em>form</em> of
the play, in what the Greeks so highly prized as <em>eurythmy</em>—a
graceful action not merely in dancing and ball-playing,
but in the most violent physical exertion.</p>

<p>But the Greeks had no playgrounds beyond the palæstra
or gymnasium; they had no playgrounds in our sense; and
though a few proverbs speak of swimming as a universal
accomplishment which boys learned, the silence of Greek<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 24</span>
literature on the subject<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> makes one very suspicious as to
the generality of such training.</p>

<p>With this introduction, we may turn to some details as
to the education of Greek boys in their palæstra.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 16. In one point, certainly, the Greeks agreed more
with the modern English than with any other civilized
nation. They regarded sport as a really serious thing.
And unless it is so regarded, it will never be brought to
the national perfection to which the English have brought
it, or to which the Greeks are supposed to have brought
it. And yet even in this point the Greeks regarded their
sports differently from us, and from all nations who have
adopted Semitic ideas in religion. Seriousness of the religious
kind is with us quite distinct from the seriousness
of sport. With the Greeks it was not, or rather seriousness
was not with them an attribute of religion in any
sense more than it was of ordinary life. They harmonized
religion and sports, not by the seriousness of their sports
so much as by the cheerfulness—a Semite, ancient or modern,
would say by the levity—of their deities; <i>for the gods,
too, love sport</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φιλοπαίγμονες γὰρ καὶ οἱ θεοί</span>), says Plato in
his “Cratylus,” a remarkable and thoroughly Greek utterance.
The greatest feasts of the gods were celebrated by
intensifying human pleasures—not merely those of the
palate, according to the grosser notion of the Christian
Middle Ages, but æsthetical pleasures, and that of excitement—pleasures,
not of idleness, but of keen enjoyment.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 17. The names applied to the exercising-places indicate
their principal uses. <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">Palæstra</i> means a wrestling-place;
<em>gymnasium</em> originally a place for naked exercise, but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 25</span>
verb early lost this connotation and came to mean mere
physical training. We hear that a short race-course (<span title="dromos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δρόμος</span>)
was often attached to the palæstra, and short it must
have been, for it was sometimes covered in (called <span title="xystos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξυστός</span>),
probably with a shed roof along the wall of the main enclosure.</p>

<p>There is no evidence to decide the point whether the
boys went to this establishment at the same age that they
went to school, and at a different hour of the day, or at a
different age, taking their physical and mental education
separately. And even in this latter case we are left in
doubt which side obtained the priority. The best authorities
among the Germans decide on separate ages for palæstra
and school, and put the palæstra first. But in the
face of many uncertainties, and some evidence the other
way, the common-sense view is preferable that both kinds
of instruction were given together, though we know nothing
about the distribution of the day, save that both are
asserted to have begun very early. Even the theoretical
schemes of Plato and Aristotle do not help us here, and it
is one of those many points which are now lost on account
of their being once so perfectly obvious and familiar.</p>

<p>We here discuss the physical side first, because it is
naturally consequent upon the home games, which have
been described, and because the mental side will naturally
connect itself with the higher education of more advanced
years. And here, too, of the great divisions of exercises
in the palæstra—<em>wrestling</em> and <em>dancing</em>, more properly exercises
of strength and of grace—we will place athletics
first, as the other naturally leads us on to the mental side.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 18. In order to leave home and reach the palæstra
safely as well as to return, Greek boys were put under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 26</span>
charge of a <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">pædagogue</i>, in no way to be identified (as it
now is) with a schoolmaster. The text “The law was our
schoolmaster, to bring us unto Christ” has suffered from
this mistake. The Greek <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">pædagogue</i> means merely the
slave who had the charge of bringing his master’s sons
safely to and from school, and guarding them from mischief
by the way. He was often old and trusty, often old
and useless, always ignorant, and never respected. He was
evidently regarded by young and gay boys as a great interference
to enjoyment, insisting upon punctual hours of
return, and limiting that intercourse with elder boys which
was so fascinating, but also so dangerous, to Greek children.</p>

<p>The keeper of the palæstra and trainer (<span title="paidotribês" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παιδοτρίβης</span>) was
not appointed by the State, but (as already mentioned)
took up the work as a private enterprise, not directed by,
but under the supervision of, the State, in the way of police
regulation. We have, indeed, in the speech of Æschines
“Against Timarchus,” very stringent laws quoted to the effect
that no palæstra or school might be open before or after
daylight; that no one above boys’ age might enter or remain
in the building; and the severest penalties, even death,
were imposed on the violation of these regulations. But
we know that, even if true, which is very doubtful, the text
of the laws here cited became a dead letter, for it was a
favorite resort of elder men to see the boys exercising.
Restrictions there were, of course; a fashionable lounge
could in no way serve as a strict training-school, and we
know that at Sparta, even in the gymnasia, the regulation
<em>strip or go</em> was enforced to prevent an idle crowd.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 19. There is figured on many vases, often in brilliant
colors, the interior of the palæstra. It is denoted by the
bearded Hermes—a rude bust of the patron god. A middle-aged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 27</span>
man in a short mantle, or <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">chlamys</i>, with a rod or
wand in his hand, is watching and directing the exercises
of the boys, generally a wrestling-match. We know also,
from the <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">pentathlon</i> being once introduced at Olympia for
boys, that its five exercises were those in which they were
usually trained—leaping, running, throwing the discus, the
spear, and wrestling. For elder boys, boxing and the <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">pancratium</i>
were doubtless added, if they meant to train for
public competitions, but ordinary gentlemen’s sons would
never undergo this special training and its hardships. Indeed,
the Spartans strictly discountenanced such sports,
both as likely to disfigure, and as sure to produce quarrels
and ill-will. The lighter exercises were intended to make
the frame hardy and the movements graceful, and were introduced
by a thorough rubbing of the skin with olive oil,
which, after the training, was scraped off with a special
instrument, the <span title="stlengis" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στλεγγίς</span>, as may be seen in the splendid
Vatican statue of the athlete scraping his arm, the so-called
<i>Apoxyomenos</i>, referred to as an original of Lysippus. In
luxurious days they also took a bath, but this was hardly
the case with ordinary boys—indeed, the water supply of
Greek towns was probably scanty enough, and the nation
not given to much washing.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 20. There remain little or no details as to the exact
rules of training practised in the ordinary palæstras, but
we may fairly assume them to have been the same in kind
(though milder in degree) as those approved for formal
athletes. If we judge from these, we will not form a high
idea of Greek training. Pausanias informs us that they
trained on dry cheese, which is not surprising, as they
were (like most southerns) not a very carnivorous people.
But when a known athlete (Dromeus<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>) discovered that meat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 28</span>
diet was the best, they seem to have followed up the discovery
by inferring that the more of a good thing the better;
and so athletes were required to eat very large quantities
of meat, owing to which they were lazy and sleepy
when not engaged in active work.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> We need not suppose
that the diet of ordinary boys was in any way interfered
with, but this particular case shows the crude notions which
prevailed, and the trainer came more and more to assume
the part of a dietetic doctor, as is stated by Plato.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 21. So much as to the conditions of good training;
as to the performance, there are points of no less significance.
All the learned Germans who write on these subjects
notice that the Olympic races were carried out on
soft sand, not on hard and springy ground, so that really
good pace cannot have been a real object to Greek runners.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
But, what is worse, they praise their zeal and energy
in starting (as we see on vases) with wild swinging of
their arms, in spread-eagle fashion, and <em>encouraging themselves
with loud shouts</em>.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> This style of running may seem
very fine to a professor in his study, but will only excite
ridicule among those who have ever made the least practical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 29</span>
essay, or seen any competitions. But possibly the
Greeks were not so uniformly silly in this respect as they
are now represented by commentators, for there is preserved
on the Acropolis at Athens one little-known vase
on which a running figure has the elbows held tightly back
in the proper way. We may also have grave suspicions
about Greek boxing, from the facts that they weighted the
hand heavily with loaded gloves, and that boxers are described
as men with their <em>ears</em>, and not with their <em>noses</em>,
crushed. We cannot but suspect them of swinging round,
and not striking straight from the shoulder. This is further
proved by the use of protecting ear-caps (<span title="amphôtides" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφωτίδες</span>)
in boxing, a thing which no modern boxer would dream of
doing.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 22. All these hints taken together make us reasonably
suspect that, <em>as athletics</em>, the training of the <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">pædotribes</i>
was not what we should admire. But, on the other hand,
the picturesque and enthusiastic descriptions of beautiful
and well-trained Greek boys, coupled with the ideal figures
which remain to us in Greek sculpture, prove beyond any
doubt that they knew perfectly what a beautiful manly
form was, and by what training it could be produced. Let
us, however, not exaggerate the matter. Very few boys
really equalled the ideal types of the sculptor; and if we
make allowance for this, we may conclude that the finest
English public-school boy is not inferior to the best Greek
types in real life.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Perhaps some advantage may have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 30</span>
resulted from the greater freedom of limb obtained by
naked training and rubbing with oil; but the advantage of
this over a modern flannel suit or tight athlete’s dress is
very small. Nevertheless, the English schoolboy is physically
so superior to the schoolboys of other European nations
that we may count him, with the Greek boy, as almost
a distinct animal.</p>

<p>What surprises us is that by regular training in the simplest
exercises, such as running, leaping, wrestling, and
throwing the discus or dart, such splendid results were
ever attained. Or shall we say that it was not the <em>wrestling</em>
but the <em>dancing</em> side of Greek training which was of
chief importance? We may dismiss with a word the fabulous
stories of athletic feats at Olympia, where a certain
Chionis, a Spartan of early date (<abbr title="Olympiad">Ol.</abbr> 28–31, <i title="circa" lang="la" xml:lang="la">cir.</i> 660 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>),
was said to have leaped fifty-two feet, and afterwards
Phayllus of Croton fifty-five feet. We may infer, too,
from the use of weights (<span title="haltêres" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἁλτῆρες</span>), that the jump was a
standing one. Happily these assertions are only made by
late grammarians, and though some German critics are inclined
to extend their adoration of Greek training to this
point, it will rather, with practical readers, tend to discredit
other statements made by the same authority. As we do
not hear of a running jump, so we do not hear of a high
jump either, at least in public games. Both may have been
practised in the palæstra. The distance for a sprint-race
for men was two hundred yards, and somewhat shorter for
boys. Their longest race at Olympia was twenty-four stadia
(4800 yards, 2⅔ miles), which the professors, without
any knowledge of the time in which it was done, think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 31</span>
more wonderful than the fifty-five-feet jump, but which is
equalled in many English sports of the present day.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 23. Apart from the doubts here raised as to the perfection
of Greek training, let us revert, in conclusion, to
the absence among elder boys of those out-of-door games,
like cricket, which are so valuable for developing mental,
together with physical, qualities. There is one feature in
these games which the Greeks seem to have missed altogether,
and which appears to be ignored in most German
books on the reform of physical education in schools. It
is that forming of clubs and teams of boys, in which they
choose their own leaders, and get accustomed to self-government
and a submission to the superior will of equals, or
the decision of public opinion among themselves. Plato
saw long ago that the proper and peculiar intention of
boys’ sports was more mental than bodily improvement.
But he confined himself to that part of the question which
advocates the cultivation of spirit in boys as better than
that which cultivates strength only. This is perfectly true,
and no game is worthy the name in which spirit and intelligence
cannot defeat brute strength. But there is little
trace, save at Sparta, of any free constitution in boys’ education,
in which they manage their own affairs, fight out
their own quarrels, and praise or censure according to a
public opinion of their own. No Greek educator seems to
have had an inkling of this, and the foreign theorists who
have discussed educational reforms on the Greek models
seem equally unaware of its importance. Yet here, if anywhere,
is the secret of that independence of character and
self-reliance which is the backbone of the English constitution
and the national liberty. The Greeks were like the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 32</span>
French and the Germans, who always imagine that the games
and sports will not prosper or be properly conducted without
the supervision of a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Turnlehrer</i>, or overseer; and they
give great exhortations to this man to sympathize with the
boys and stimulate them. In England the main duty of
such people is to keep out of the way and let the boys
manage their own affairs. The results of the opposed systems
will strike any one who compares, on the one hand,
the neat and well-regulated French boys of a boarding-school,
walking two-and-two, with gloves on and toes
turned out, along a road, followed by a master; on the
other, the playgrounds of any good English school during
recreation time. If the zealous and learned reformers who
write books on the subject in modern Europe would take
the trouble to come and see this for themselves, it might
modify both their encomia on Greek training and their
suggestions for their own countries.</p>

problem, so apt to be lost or obscured amid details.
“Education and admonition commence in the very first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 33</span>
years of childhood, and last to the very end of life. Mother
and nurse and father and tutor (<span title="paidagôgos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παιδαγωγός</span>) are quarrelling
about the improvement of the child as soon as ever
he is able to understand them. He cannot say or do anything
without their setting forth to him that this is just
and that is unjust; that this is honorable, that is dishonorable;
this is holy, that is unholy; do this, and abstain from
that. And if he obeys, well and good; if not, he is
straightened by threats and blows, like a piece of warped
wood. At a later stage they send him to teachers, and
enjoin them to see to his manners even more than to his
reading and music; and the teachers do as they are desired.
And when the boy has learned his letters, and is
beginning to understand what is written, as before he understood
only what was spoken, they put into his hands
the works of great poets, which he reads at school; in
these are contained many admonitions, and many tales and
praises, and encomia of ancient famous men, which he is
required to learn by heart, in order that he may imitate or
emulate them, and desire to become like them. Then,
again, the teachers of the lyre take similar care that their
young disciple is steady and gets into no mischief; and
when they have taught him the use of the lyre, they introduce
him to the works of other excellent poets, who are
the lyric poets; and these they set to music, and make
their harmonies and rhythms quite familiar to the children,
in order that they may learn to be more gentle and harmonious
and rhythmical, and so more fitted for speech and
action; for the life of man in every part has need of harmony
and rhythm. Then they send them to the master
of gymnastics, in order that their bodies may better minister
to the virtuous mind, and that the weakness of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 34</span>
bodies may not force them to play the coward in war or
on any other occasion. This is what is done by those who
have the means, and those who have the means are the
rich; their children begin education soonest and leave off
latest. When they have done with masters, the State, again,
compels them to learn the laws, and live after the pattern
which they furnish, and not after their own fancies; and
just as in learning to write, the writing-master first draws
lines with a stylus for the use of the young beginner, and
gives him the tablet, and makes him follow the lines, so
the city draws the laws, which were the invention of good
lawgivers which were of old time; these are given to the
young man in order to guide him in his conduct, whether
as ruler or ruled; and he who transgresses them is to be
corrected or called to account, which is a term used not
only in your country, but in many others.”</p>

<p>This is the argument put by Plato into the mouth of
Protagoras the sophist, to show that virtue is a thing which
can be taught, and not a mere natural predisposition or a
divine grace. The other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">locus classicus</i>, which may be referred
to in close connection with it, is the description of
the traditional education given in Aristophanes’ “Clouds.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 35</span>
The strict discipline of boys who were not allowed to utter
a whisper before their elders; who were sent in troops early
in the morning to school, in their single tunic, even in the
deepest winter snow; who were kept at work with the music-master
studying old traditional hymns, and in attitudes
strictly controlled as regards modesty and decency—all this
is contrasted by the poet with what he considers the corruption
of the youth with florid and immoral music, their
meretricious desire to exhibit their bodily and mental perfections,
their luxury and sloth, their abandonment of sobriety
and diligence.</p>

<p>There are peculiarities of Greek taste so openly alluded
to in this passage that it will not bear literal translation
into English, at least into a book for ordinary readers; and
therefore it need only be remarked, in criticism of it, that
too much stress has been laid by theorists on Greek life,
both on the picture of over-anxious morality in the older
time, and on the alleged immorality of the poet’s age. It
is from such passages that German historians draw their
very extravagant assertions of the rapid degeneracy of the
Athenians under what they call the <i>ochlocracy</i>, which followed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 36</span>
upon the death of Pericles. It is very easy to find
in many other ages and times similar assertions of the glory
of the good old times, and the degeneracy of the satirist’s
own contemporaries. But there is generally no more truth
in it than in the assertion of Homer that his heroes took
up and threw easily great rocks which two, or five, or ten
men, such as they now are, could not lift. The same sort
of thing was said in poetry of the mediæval knights in
comparison with modern Europe. One would imagine
them of greater size and might than we are, and yet their
suits of armor are seldom large enough for a man six feet
high. The picture of Aristophanes is doubtless a deliberate
exaggeration, and would have been readily acknowledged
as such by the poet himself. But it, of course, gives
us the extremes possible in real life, as he knew it, and is
therefore of use in forming our ideas on the question, if we
use common sense and caution.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 25. With the exception of this feature, that Greek
parents showed a greater apprehension for the morals of
their boys, and guarded them as we should guard the morals
of girls, it will be seen that the principles of education
are permanent, and applicable in all ages under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>But what the ancients called <em>music</em> in the wider sense
must be held to include a knowledge and recitation of
good poetry, as well as proper training in that figured
dancing which was the most usual service of the gods.
Indeed, a good musical education in Greece, much in contrast
to ours, included every graceful æsthetical and intellectual
accomplishment. This wide use of the term, however,
though co-ordinate with the ordinary sense of playing
instruments and singing, causes little confusion. A distinction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 37</span>
between “music and singing,” such as we often see
it (not satirically) set forth in the advertisements of our
professional teachers, was not admitted.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 26. I think we may be justified in asserting that the
study of the epic poets, especially of the “Iliad” and “Odyssey,”
was the earliest intellectual exercise of schoolboys, and,
in the case of fairly educated parents, even anticipated the
learning of letters. For the latter is never spoken of as
part of a mother’s or of home education. Reading was
not so universal or so necessary as it now is; and as it was
in earlier days an accomplishment only gradually becoming
an essential, its acquisition seems always to have been intrusted
to a professional master, the <span title="grammatistês" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γραμματιστής</span>, or grammarian
in the earlier use of the word. Of course, careful
parents, of the model above set forth by Protagoras, must
have inculcated early lessons from poetry before that age.
We may assume that books of Homer were read or recited
to growing boys, and that they were encouraged or required
to learn them off by heart.</p>

<p>This is quite certain to all who estimate justly the
enormous influence ascribed to Homer, and the principles
assumed by the Greeks to have underlain his work. He
was universally considered to be a <em>moral teacher</em>, whose
characters were drawn with a moral intent, and for the purpose
of example or avoidance. In Plato’s “Ion” we distinctly
find something supernatural, some distinct inspiration by
the muse, asserted of Homer; and this inspiration was even
passed on, like some magnetic force, from bard to bard.
These ancient poets were even supposed to have uttered
words deeper and holier than they themselves knew, being
driven by some divine <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">œstrus</i> to compose what they could
not have said in their natural state. Accordingly, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 38</span>
“Iliad” and “Odyssey” were supposed to contain all that
was useful, not only for godliness, but for life. All the arts
and sciences were to be derived (by interpretation) from
these sacred texts.</p>

<p>Hence, when it occurs to a modern reader that the main
superiority of our education over the Greek is the early
training in the Scriptures—a training, alas! decaying in
earnestness every day—an old Athenian or Milesian or
Cean would deny the fact, and say that they, too, had an
inspired volume, written for their learning, in which all the
moral virtues and all the necessaries of faith were contained.
The charge of objectionable passages in the old
epic would doubtless be retorted by a similar charge
against the old Semitic books.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 27. It is well-nigh impossible that in the higher families
throughout Greece this moral training should not have
begun at home; and there must have been many Greek
mothers able and anxious to help, though history is silent
about them, and does not even single out individual cases,
like the Roman Cornelia, where mothers influenced the
moral and intellectual training of their children.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Certain
it is that here and there we find evidences of a strong feeling
of respect to the house-mother which contrast curiously
with the usual silence about women. In the “Clouds,” the
acme of villany in the young scapegrace who has turned
sophist under Socrates’ hands is to threaten violence to his
mother.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Here it is that Strepsiades exclaims in real horror
at the result of such teaching. We also find both Plato
and (perhaps in imitation of him) Cicero laying stress upon
the purity of speech preserved in the conversation of cultivated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 39</span>
women, whose conservative life and tastes rejected
slang and novelty, and thus preserved the language pure
and undefiled. The very opposite complaint is made concerning
the pædagogues, whose often barbarous origin and
rude manners were of damage to the youth.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 28. On the question of punishments, both at home
and at school, we do not find the Greeks very different
from ourselves. There are not in Greek literature any such
eloquent protests against corporal punishment as we find in
Seneca and Quintilian. They all acknowledge the use and
justice of it, and only caution against applying servile punishments
to free boys. Indeed, in many later writers, such
as Lucian, the severities of schoolmasters are noted; and we
have among the Pompeian pictures a scene of a master
flogging a boy, who is hoisted on the shoulders of another,
with a third holding him up by the heels. These evidences,
together with those of the later Romans, on the sounds of
woe common in schools, must not be overestimated. They
are probably exceptional cases made prominent for satirical
purposes, and not implying any peculiar savagery in Greek
above modern masters.</p>

<p>Most certainly the Greek schoolmaster was not harsher
than the lower-class masters in many primary schools, as,
for example, the Irish hedge schoolmasters described in
Carleton’s “Tales of the Irish Peasantry.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Greek schoolmaster, at least of elementary
schools, was not generally in high repute, was evidently
not highly paid, and his calling was not such as to
give him either dignity or self-respect. He was accused of
pedantry if he was really learned, and of bad temper if he
was zealous and impatient at idleness.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 40</span>Lucian, in a jocose description of the nether world, describes
kings and satraps as beggars or “primary” schoolmasters,
and was only carrying out into fiction the proverbial
downfall of the tyrant Dionysius of Syracuse, who
spent his old-age teaching children at Corinth. An unknown
comic writer is quoted as saying, “The man is either
dead or teaching the alphabet.” We hear of philosophers
accusing each other—very absurdly—of having once followed
this profession; and every scholar will remember the
famous passage in Demosthenes’ “De Corona:” “But you,
worthy man, who despise others compared with yourself,
now compare with mine your own lot, which consigned
you to grow up from boyhood in the greatest need, when
you helped your father to attend in the school, preparing
the ink, cleaning the benches, sweeping out the schoolroom,
and so taking the rank of a slave, and not of a free boy.”
We even hear of Horace’s master, Orbilius, writing a lamentable
autobiography on account of his miseries, under
the title of <em>the man acquainted with grief</em> (<span title="perialgês" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περιαλγής</span>).</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 29. The general question of the payment of teachers
will be better discussed when we come to the Sophists’
training of riper youth. Indeed, on the whole value of the
various attacks on the teaching order in Greece, Grasberger
concludes his elaborate summary of the above and many
other facts with the sensible remark:<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> “As regards the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 41</span>
unpleasant and objectionable features, which men seem to
record with special preference, the true state of the case
may be the same as with the many scandals which are reported
from the life of the mediæval universities in Europe.
Evil did not predominate; but the chronicler, instead of
putting forward the modest virtues of diligence and of scientific
earnestness, preferred to note both the faults of the
teachers and the gross excesses of the students.”</p>

<p>We may be sure that in the Greek primary schools,
though we hear of one assistant sometimes, the master was
required to teach all the subjects. This was so not long
ago in England, and still more in Ireland, where the hedge
schoolmasters, but lately supplanted by the national school
system (not without considerable loss), were required, and
were able, to teach classics, mathematics, and the old-fashioned
English. It is, indeed, clearly presupposed in all
the many bequests of pious benefactors, who leave forty or
sixty pounds per annum for the payment of a single master
to keep a school in some remote part of the country. And
at Athens, as in the days of these bequests, there was no
official or state test of a master’s qualifications. Each man
set up on his private account; it depended on the reputation
he made whether his school was well attended. The
worthy pedant in Goldsmith’s “Deserted Village” gives us
a fair specimen of the better class of such men.</p>

<span class="fs75">THE MUSICAL SIDE—SCHOOLS AND THEIR APPOINTMENTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="sp1">§ 30. The school was generally distinguished by the
term <span title="didaskaleion" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διδασκαλεῖον</span><a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> from the palæstra. We know that every
Greek town possessed one or more, and in early times
Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> mentions one existing at Chios as early as 500
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, of which the roof fell in and killed one hundred and
nineteen out of one hundred and twenty children at work
within it at the time. Pausanias tells of another at Astypalæa,
into which a madman rushed and pulled down
the supporting pillar, so that sixty boys were buried under
the ruins. The sad affair of Mycalessus is told by Thucydides,
and extorts from him a most ungrammatical grimace
of pity, when Thracian mercenaries murdered all the children
assembled in school. These cases show how it was
evidently regarded as an essential in every town. So the
Trœzenians, when they received the fugitive Athenians
during the invasion of Xerxes, took care, even in that
great and sudden crisis, to provide for the teaching of the
Attic children.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Of course, in early days and in poor
towns, the place of teaching was not well appointed; nay,
even in many places teaching in the open air prevailed.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 43</span>The oldest legends speak of Cheiron teaching in his grotto
on Pelion; in the latest Greek <span title="chamaididaskalos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαμαιδιδάσκαλος</span> (<em>teacher on
the ground</em>) is a word for a low class of teacher. This
was, again, like the old hedge schools of Ireland, and, no
doubt, of Scotland too. They also took advantage, especially
in hot weather, of colonnades, or shady corners
among public buildings; as at Winchester the summer
term was called <em>cloister-time</em>, from a similar practice, even
in that wealthy foundation, of instructing in the cloisters.</p>

<p>On the other hand, properly appointed schools in respectable
towns were furnished with some taste, and according
to traditional notions. As in gymnasia and palæstras,
there was a shrine of the Muses or of Hermes, and
the head of the institution was regarded as the priest of
this shrine, at which offerings were made, so in the schools
also there were statues of tutelary gods set up, and busts
of heroes and other eminent men, by way of ornament as
well as reminder to the boys.</p>

<p>We hear that the master sat on a high seat, from which
he taught; the scholars often sat on the ground, as they
still do in many countries, or else they stood or occupied
benches round him. The pictures and descriptions extant
do not point to the schools being so crowded, as appears
from the accidents above cited; but this is probably a
mere chance, or an omission for the artist’s convenience.
For though the laws quoted in Æschines’ speech forbid
any one save the master and boys to be present, we know
that in later days this was not strictly observed, and in
Theophrastus’s “Characters,” the Chatterbox, among other
mistakes in tact, is represented going into the schools and
interrupting lessons with his idle talk. We may be sure
that there were no tables or desks, such furniture being unusual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 44</span>
in Greek houses; it was the universal custom, while
reading or writing, to hold the book or roll on the knee—to
us an inconvenient thing to do, but still common in the East.</p>

<p>There are some interesting sentences, given for exercise
in Greek and Latin, in the little-known “Interpretamenta”
of Dositheus, now edited and explained by German scholars.
The entry of the boy is thus described, in parallel Greek
and Latin: “First I salute the master, who returns my salute:
good-morning, master; good-morning, school-fellows.
Give me my place, my seat, my stool. Sit closer.
Move up that way. This is my place, I took it first.”
This mixture of politeness and wrangling is amusing, and,
no doubt, to be found in all ages. It seems that the seats
were movable. A scholium on Æschines tells us that
there was a supply of water close at hand, lest the boys
might suffer from thirst.</p>

<p>The extant pictures show that along the walls were
hung up various vessels of which the use is not always
plain to us. But we can clearly distinguish the necessary
implements for the teaching of reading and writing, boxes
for book-rolls, writing-boards, reckoning-boards with parallel
grooves, and pebbles fixed in them, geometrical figures,
flute-cases, and lyres. There is also late authority to show
that there were notice-boards on which regulations were
posted. We hear from Lucian of a notice over a sophist’s
door, “No philosophy to-day.” The notice-board was
called “the white board,” being covered with chalk. We
are not told how this was written on; but if the ground
was black, then mere writing with the finger across the
chalked surface would produce distinct characters.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 31. What is far more interesting is the remnant now
discovered of the pictorial teaching of children, by hanging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 45</span>
up in the schoolroom illustrations of the Trojan and other
legends. By the researches of Böttiger and O. Jahn,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> it
appears that we still have the fragments of such a table in
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabula Iliaca</i> of Theodorus, preserved at the Capitoline
Museum in Rome. These were large pictures, in a series,
with names or words of explanation attached to them.
Thus we have one picture (from “Iliad” <span title="1">Α</span>) of Chryses
praying Agamemnon to restore his daughter, beside him
a wagon loaded with ransom, and under each figure, and
under the wagon respectively, <i>Agamemnon</i>, <i>Chryses</i>, <i>the
ransom</i>. Other extant pictures illustrate the third and
twenty-fourth books of the “Iliad.” The “Odyssey” was
similarly treated, so that there seems to have been a traditional
and widely circulated pictorial compendium of the
Homeric poems used, at all events, in later Greek and in
Roman schools. There are also chronological and historical
fragments of the same kind still extant, so that it is
more than probable that even in classical days Greek boys
were not without the benefit of illustrated school-books, or
at least school-sheets, as the elegiac distich on the back of
one of them suggests.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The use of these pictures on the
walls explains the constant appearance of a long wand in
the master’s hand, which is more characteristic of him than
the rod of punishment, though this, too, was not missing.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3><span class="fs75">THE SUBJECTS AND METHOD OF EDUCATION—THE THREE R’S.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class="sp1">§ 32. The usual subdivision of education was into three
parts: <em>letters</em> (<span title="grammata" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γράμματα</span>), including reading, writing, counting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 46</span>
and learning of the poets; <em>music</em> in the stricter sense,
including singing and playing on the lyre; and lastly <em>gymnastic</em>,
which included dancing. These were under the
special direction of three classes of masters, the <em>grammatists</em>
(to be distinguished from <span title="grammatikos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γραμματικός</span>, used in a higher
sense), the <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">citharistes</i>, and the <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">pædotribes</i>. It is said that
at Sparta the education in reading and writing was not
thought necessary, and there have been long discussions
among the learned whether the ordinary Spartan in classical
days was able to read. We find that Aristotle adds a
fourth subject to the three above named—drawing, which
he thinks requisite, like music, to enable the educated man
to judge rightly of works of art. But there is no evidence
of a wide diffusion of drawing or painting among the
Greeks, as among us; and the same may be said of swimming
on the gymnastic side, though the oft-quoted proverb,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μηδὲ νεῖν μηδὲ γράμματα</span>—<i>he can neither swim nor read</i>—has
led the learned to assert a general knowledge of swimming,
at least at Athens.</p>

<p>Later on, under the learned influences of Alexandria and
the paid professoriate of Roman days, subjects multiplied
with the decline of mental vigor and spontaneity of the
age, and children began to be pestered, as they now are,
with a quantity of subjects, all thought necessary to a
proper education, and accordingly all imperfectly acquired.
This was called the <em>encyclical education</em>, which is preserved
in our <em>encyclopædia</em> of knowledge. It included (1) grammar,
(2) rhetoric, (3) dialectic, (4) arithmetic, (5) music, (6)
geometry, (7) astronomy, and these were divided into the
earlier <i>Trivium</i> and the later <i>Quadrivium</i>. But fortunately
this debasement of classical education is far beyond
our present scope.</p>

<p class="sp1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 47</span>§ 33. The boys started very early for school, attended
by their pædagogue, and appear to have returned for late
breakfast. We may conclude from the Roman custom,
though we have no positive evidence, that the afternoons
were devoted to recreation or the lighter gymnastic exercises.
The later theorists speak much of pauses and of
variation in study; but though we know there were a good
many isolated holidays, we hear of no period of rest for
both masters and boys, such as there must have been in the
Roman dog-days. There is something humane and affecting
in the dying bequest of Anaxagoras, who gave his native
city, Clazomenæ, a property on the condition that the
anniversary of his death should be kept as a general school
holiday. There were also special days of school feasts,
such as the <i>Hermæa</i> and <i>Museia</i>, so elegantly described at
the opening of Plato’s “Lysis.”</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 34. From the accounts we have of the teaching of the
alphabet, as implied in Plato’s “Cratylus,” and described
by Dionysius (the rhetor) in illustrating Demosthenes’ eloquence,
it was not carried on in an analytical, but a synthetical,
way. Children were not taught words first and
then to analyze them, but started with individual letters,
then learned their simplest combinations, and so on. Nor
is this method ever likely to be supplanted by the other, at
least in the case of stupid children. But we do hear of one
curious attempt to make the alphabet an agreeable study in
the so-called <em>grammatical tragedy</em> of Callias, about 400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
This was the time when (in the archonship of Eucleides)
the newer Ionic alphabet of twenty-four letters was introduced,
and apparently ordered to be used in schools. The
work of Callias was, accordingly, a poetical kind of A B C
book, in which the single letters in turn spoke the prologue.
The choral parts seem to have been refrains working out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 48</span>
the simpler combinations of vowels with each consonant.
The seven vowels were also introduced before the schoolmaster
as female characters. But more we do not know,
and it is probable that the book was only called <em>tragedy</em>
from its external form, not from any plot.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The use of
mnemonic verses to help children was, no doubt, as old as
education; but we should have been glad to know the divisions
of letters followed by Callias; for up to the times
of the Sophists there was no proper analysis of the alphabet,
and it is to them that we owe such studies as Plato’s
“Cratylus,” which, though sound as to the alphabet, is wonderfully
childish as to etymology. Still, the popular knowledge
of 400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> must have been a long way behind the
“Cratylus.”</p>

<p>From the acquisition of letters, the child passed to the
study of <em>syllables</em>, and we find <em>syllabizing</em> used generally
by the Greeks for elementary instruction in reading. But
while the Greek child was not afflicted, like English children,
with the absurd conundrums of a perfectly irrational
spelling; while he had a fair guarantee that the individual
letters reproduced the sound of the whole word, there were
other difficulties in his way. He had not, indeed, to burden
his memory with the sounds to be attached to symbols
like <i>though</i> and <i>tough</i>, <i>plague</i> and <i>ague</i>, but he must, on
the other hand, study with peculiar care the separation of
words—interpunction—and also punctuation and accent.
Accent, indeed, and the subtle use of the numerous particles,
were given, and could only be given, by familiarity
with Greek as a mother tongue. As Aristotle remarks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 49</span>
one could always know a foreigner, however well he spoke
Greek, by the use of the particles. I heard Ernest Renan
make the very same remark about foreigners’ French a few
years ago. But in classical days, accents were not even
written, and words were not separated, neither were clauses
distinguished by stops. Hence the difficulties of reading
were considerably increased, as any one may prove for himself
by taking up a mediæval Greek <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> There, indeed,
the accents are a guide, but even with them the separation
of words is a difficulty, and has led to endless mistakes in
our printed texts. We know, too, that the Greeks were
particular about melodious intonation and rhythmical balance
of clauses even in prose: all this gave the <em>grammatist</em>
ample scope for patience. There is even a special teacher—<span title="phônaskos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φωνασκός</span>—mentioned
in early days as regulating and
training the singing voice of children. Indeed, we are surprised
at the general assumption among their educators
that every one had both natural voice and ear.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Thus reading aloud and recitations from the great poets
attained a double object: the schoolboy was taught to
enounce accurately and read rhythmically; he was made
familiar at the same time with the choicest extracts of the
best masters in the older literature. I have already spoken
of Homer; but the lyric poets, like Tyrtæus, and the
gnomic, like Theognis, were also largely used at school.
Indeed, it is not a little remarkable how many of these old
poets were themselves called schoolmasters. This school<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 50</span>
use gave rise to <i>chrestomathies</i>, or selections of suitable
passages; and there are many critics who think that our
present texts of Theognis represent such a selection. The
“Golden Verses” of Pythagoras, the many collections of
proverbs, or <span title="hypothêkai" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑποθῆκαι</span>, point to the same practice. Written
books were still scarce, libraries very exceptional, and thus
the boy’s education was far more prosecuted by dictation
and by conversation than nowadays. Without doubt this
made them less learned, but more intelligent and ready,
than we are; and there are even in the days of Hellenic
decay complaints of the increase of books, of the lust after
much reading and various lore.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> We are told that in
Sparta and Crete all children learned hymns to the gods,
and metrical statements of the laws, to be sung to fixed
melodies; and this (if a fact) has justly been called a political
as well as religious catechism.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 35. It was very late in the history of Hellenism that
any mention of the learning of foreign languages meets us.
Even in the wide studies pursued at Alexandria, no systematic
course in languages is ever mentioned; and people
still had recourse in international business to those who
happened to be born of mixed marriages, or by some other
accident had been compelled to acquire a second tongue.
There is, indeed, much curious evidence that the Greeks,
being really bad linguists, found great difficulty in acquiring
the Latin tongue, even when it became the language
of the rulers of the world.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Strabo<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> notes that whenever
historical treatises were composed in foreign languages,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 51</span>
they were inaccessible to the Greeks, while the Romans
did nothing but copy partially and imperfectly what the
Greeks had said—a remark which might now be sarcastically
applied to the relations of German and English philology.
This Greek inability to learn, or contempt of, foreign
languages reminds us of the French of to-day, whose
language, until lately, held the place in Europe which
Greek held in the Roman Empire, when every respectable
person knew Greek, and when the Senate were able to
receive and treat with foreign ambassadors speaking in
Greek.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> We have above noted the danger actually threatening
that children might learn Greek so early and exclusively
as to speak their native tongue with a foreign accent—a
state of things which the Romans would have resented
strongly in their rulers—in that respect widely different
from the English people of to-day. Thus the Romans attained,
what the Greeks missed, the opportunity of learning
grammar through the forms of a foreign language.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p class="sp1">§ 36. When the children came to writing, we must not
imagine them using ink and paper, which was far too expensive.
Instead of our slate, they used tablets covered
with wax, on which the pointed stylus drew a sharp line,
which could be smoothed out again with the flat reverse
end. There were double lines drawn on the tablets, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 52</span>
the master wrote words for the boys to copy. We are
told that he at times held the hands of beginners in forming
letters. Quintilian suggests that the letters should be
cut deep in a wooden tablet, so that the child could follow
them without having his hand held; and it was in this
way that the Ostrogoth Theodoric managed to sign his
name, by having a metal plate pierced with it, which he
then laid on the paper, and stencilled out the letters.
There are on the walls of Pompeii many scribblings of
boys, evidently repeating their school exercises; and in
Egypt was found a tomb with a set of wax tablets, all
containing the same verses of Menander; but one of them
a model, the rest copies varying in excellence; and under
some of them the approving judgment <em>diligent</em> (<span title="philoponôs" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φιλοπόνως</span>).
This curious set of relics, in the possession of Dr. Abbott,
of New York, is apparently the school furniture of a master
buried with him.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 37. There is no reason to think that the average
Greek attained anything like the fluency in writing which
we now consider necessary. Plato<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> says it is only necessary
so far as to be able to write or read; to write fast or
elegantly must not be attempted within the range of ordinary
education, except in rare cases and with peculiar
natural gifts. Indeed, as slaves did all the copying work,
and as published books were always in their handwriting,
there may have been the same sort of prejudice against a
very good, clear hand which many people now feel against
an <em>office hand</em>. At Athens there was a special officer,
<span title="grammateus" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γραμματεύς</span>, to write out, or direct the writing-out of, public
documents; there was also a <span title="hypographeus" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπογραφεύς</span>, a secretary to
take minutes (<span title="hypographesthai" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπογράφεσθαι</span>) at public meetings. Besides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 53</span>
the formal writing in separate capital letters, which we
have on so many inscriptions, and which was probably the
hand taught to children, there was a cursive hand, which we
see in the Greek papyri of the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> found
in Egypt. In later <abbr title="manuscripts">MSS.</abbr> we even find a regular shorthand,
exceedingly difficult to decipher.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The lines were drawn,
especially on wax, with a little coin-shaped piece of lead
(<span title="molybdos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μόλυβδος</span>), and the drawing of lines appears to be called
<span title="paragraphein" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παραγράφειν</span>. Instead of the sharp metal or bone stylus,
a reed (<span title="kalamos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κάλαμος</span>), like our pens, was used on papyrus or
parchment with ink. Quintilian prefers the wax and stylus,
because the constant dipping in the ink distracts and
checks thinking—a curious objection, and worth quoting
to show the difference between his age and ours. But
when the new stylograph has been used for some time, we
will, no doubt, find men asserting this of the old-fashioned
pen and ink.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 38. The school commentary, or explanation of the
poems or other literature thus written out, was probably
quite elementary. Grammar only began to be understood
by the Sophists, and we have specimens of exercises on the
use of the article, and on the question of genders, in a very
comic dialogue in Aristophanes’ “Clouds,” where the pupil
of the new school ridicules the ignorance of old Strepsiades.
It is likely Protagoras’s work <cite>on the correct use of language</cite>
(<span title="orthoepeia" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀρθοέπεια</span>) gave a great stimulus to this branch of education.
But we cannot argue that these studies of the
mother tongue which make our use of it more conscious
than before, had any better effect on prose-writing or on
conversation than the very parallel studies of English which
have of late years invaded or infested all our schools. Good-breeding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 54</span>
and natural refinement seem the natural (and are
probably the only) safeguards of a mother tongue in its
ordinary use, and there is even great danger that a conscious
analysis of idioms may banish from the writing of a
language many valuable and characteristic turns which are
based upon a more subtle propriety than that of school
logic. Fortunately, local dialects have a great power of
resistance. The Warwick or the Galway peasant will speak
his own accents, and even use his idioms, in spite of all
compulsory teaching of English grammar in the schools;
but the reducing of all written English to one standard
(both in spelling and in idiom) is like the reducing of all
written Greek to the <em>common dialect</em>—a very great loss
and damage.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p class="sp1">§ 39. We pass to the teaching of elementary science.
Geometry was still an advanced study, and, though in high
esteem among the Greeks as one of the most elegant and
perfect, seems not to have been taught in schools. Arithmetic
was regarded either as the abstract science of numbers
(<span title="arithmêtikê" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀριθμητική</span>), and as such one of the most difficult of
sciences, or as the art of reckoning (<span title="logistikê" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λογιστική</span>) to be employed
in the ordinary affairs of life. Mercantile Greeks,
like <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 55</span>the Athenians and Ionians generally, among whom
banking was well developed, must have early found this a
necessity; but even in Greek art, architectural perfection
was attained by a very subtle and evidently conscious application
of arithmetical proportions. This was first shown
in the accurate measurements of the Parthenon by Penrose,
and was, no doubt, expounded in the treatise written on this
building by its architect, Ictinus. In the great temple of
Zeus at Olympia, the use of multiples of 7 and 5 has been
shown so curiously applied by an American scholar that
he suspects the application of Pythagorean symbolism by
the architect Libon. But of course this was <span title="arithmêtikê" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀριθμητική</span> in
the strict sense, and is only here mentioned to show how
the Greeks must have been led to appreciate the value of
the science of numbers. Ordinary schoolboys were taught
to add, subtract, multiply, and divide, as they now are, but
without the advantage of our admirable system of notation.</p>

<p>Starting from the natural suggestion of the fingers—a
suggestion preserved all through later history by such words
as <span title="pempazesthai" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πεμπάζεσθαι</span> (literally, <em>to count by fives</em>, but used of
counting generally)—the Greeks represented numbers by
straight strokes, but soon replaced <span class="bold gesperrt2" title="five vertical strokes">|||||</span> either by a rude
picture of a hand, V (as we find in Roman numbers), and
made two such symbols joined together to represent 10
(X), or else the higher numbers were marked by the first
letter of their name—viz., M and C, in Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mille</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centum</i>.
So in Greek, <span title="Chi">Χ</span> (<span title="chilioi" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χίλιοι</span>), <span title="Mu">Μ</span> (<span title="myrioi" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μυρίοι</span>), <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr> The smaller
numbers were represented in ordinary counting by the
fingers of the hand, not merely as <em>digits</em> (a suggestive
word, in itself a survival of the process), but, according as
they were bent or placed, fingers represented multiples of
5, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 56</span> so were sufficient for ordinary sums. Aristophanes
even contrasts<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> this sort of reckoning, as clearer and more
intelligible, with reckoning on the abacus, or arithmetical
board, which has still survived in our ball-frames. We
are told that the fingers were sufficient to express all figures
up to thousands, which is indeed strange to us; but
both the finger signs and the abacus failed in the great invention
we have gained from Arabic numerals, the supplying
of the symbol <span title="zero" class="bold">&#x25CB;</span>. The abacus used in Greek schools
appears to have had several straight furrows in which pebbles
or plugs were set, and at the left side there was a
special division where each unit meant 5. Thus, 648
(DCXXXXVIII) was represented in the following way:</p>

<p>This abacus was ascribed to Pythagoras, but was in all
probability older, and derived from Egypt, where elementary
science was well and widely taught from very early
times. When initial letters were used for numbers, as <span title="Pi">Π</span> for
<span title="pente" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πέντε</span>, and <span title="Delta">Δ</span> for <span title="deka" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δέκα</span>,
combinations such as
<span class="figinline">
<img src="images/fifty.png" alt="Pi-Delta ligature" />
</span>
meant 50. Last of all, we find in our <abbr title="manuscripts">MSS.</abbr> a system of using the letters
of the alphabet for numbers, preserving <span title="stigma">ϛ</span> (<span title="episêmon" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίσημον</span>) for
6, and thus reaching 10 with <span title="iota">ι</span>, proceeding by tens through
<span title="kappa">κ</span> (20), <span title="lambda">λ</span> (30), <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>, to <span title="rho">ρ</span> (100), <span title="sigma">σ</span> (200), and for 900 using
<span title="Sampi">Ϡ</span>. This notation must not be confused with the marking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 57</span>
of the twenty-four books of the Homeric epics by the simple
letters of the alphabet.</p>

<p>Further details as to the technical terms for arithmetical
operations, and the amount to be attributed to a nation
using so clumsy a notation, must be sought in professed
hand-books of antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>As regards geometry, all we can say is that in the days
of Plato and Aristotle both these philosophers recognize
not only its extraordinary value as a mental training, but
also the fact that it can be taught to young boys as yet
unfit for political and metaphysical studies.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 40. Having thus disposed of the severer side of school
education, we will turn to the artistic side, one very important
to the Greeks, and suggestive to us of many instructive
problems.</p>

local idioms by stamping them with the mark of vulgarity. This
latter is the natural and right consequence of having classical models.
But had we possessed the older dialects in phonetic writing, our
standard would have been widened, like that of the Greeks, to include
important provincial varieties.</p>

<span class="fs75">THE SUBJECTS AND METHOD OF EDUCATION—DRAWING AND MUSIC.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="sp1">§ 41. It is likely that most writers on Greek education
have exaggerated the importance and diffusion of drawing
as an ordinary school subject. Even in Aristotle’s day it
was only recognized by some people, probably theorists;<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 58</span> Pliny tells us that it was Pamphilus, Apelles’ master,
who first had it introduced at Sicyon, from which it spread
over all Greece. These combined notices point to its not
being general before the days of Alexander. But the
theorists recognized its use and importance earlier, first and
most obviously for critical purposes, that men might better
judge and appreciate works of art; secondly, for that æsthetical
effect which is so forgotten by us, the unconscious
moulding of the mind to beauty by the close and accurate
study of beautiful forms.</p>

<p>The usual word <span title="zôgraphia" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζωγραφία</span> for painting, and <span title="zôgraphos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζωγράφος</span>
for drawing-master, suggests to us that <em>figure-drawing</em> was
the early and the principal branch of the art known and
taught. From the earliest times rude figures had been
scratched and colored on vases, and the number of vase-painters
in historical Greece must have been so considerable
as to disseminate some general feeling for the art,
though we hear of no amateur vase-painting, such as is in
fashion among ladies of our own day. On the other hand,
landscape-painting was of late growth and very imperfect
development. The prominence of sculpture, even polychromatic
sculpture, made its absence less felt. Owing to
the old Greek habit of personifying nature, and expressing
every mountain and river by its tutelary gods, we find in
the great pediment sculptures of the best epoch that curious
indication of the landscape by its tutelary gods—looking
on calmly and unconsciously at the action of the principal
figures—which is perhaps the most peculiar characteristic
of all Greek art. Thus the local rivers, the Alpheus
and Cladeus, are represented lying at the ends of the great
eastern pediment of the temple at Olympia, witnessing the
combat of Pelops and Œnomaus with no more expression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 59</span>
of feeling than the landscape which they represent would
manifest.</p>

<p>The earliest essays at landscape proper were, moreover,
not rocks and trees, or that wild country which the Greeks
never loved, but buildings and artificial grounds, with regular
lines and definite design. The first attempt was made
to satisfy the requirements of the theatre, and the fact that
scene-painting and shade-painting (or perspective) were used
as synonymous terms shows the truth of the report that
Apollodorus (<i title="circa" lang="la" xml:lang="la">cir.</i> 400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) first discovered the art of representing
the straight lines of a building in depth, by a departure
from that <em>orthography</em> in geometrical drawing
which had hitherto been practised.</p>

<p>If we may judge from the many sketches of this sort of
suburban landscape which are preserved on Pompeian walls,
the proper knowledge of perspective was not even in later
times diffused among ordinary artists, whose figure-painting
on these walls is in every respect vastly superior. On the
other hand, the figure-painting even on vases of the best
epoch is so conventional that we cannot believe Greek boys
were taught to draw figures with a proper knowledge of
living or round models, and must assume the drawing-lessons
to have been chiefly in geometrical designs.</p>

<p>According to Ælian, there were maps of the Greek world
to be had at Athens, and therefore presumably in schools,
when Alcibiades was a young man; but this isolated notice,
backed up by one or two allusions in Aristophanes, must
not be pressed too far. The confusion between the terms
for drawing and for writing utensils arises from the same
materials being used in practising both—as if we used pencils
only in learning to write. The same stylus (<span title="graphis" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γραφίς</span>)
which was used for writing on wax tablets was used for
drawing outlines on the same; and the earliest training in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 60</span>
drawing, if we may trust the statement of Böttiger, was
the copying of the outlines of models proposed by the
master.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> After firmness had been attained, delicacy of outline
was practised, and ultimately a fine paint, which was
used to paint black and red outlines on white tables, or
white on black.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 42. Though the diffusion of drawing was late and
doubtful, this was not the case with music, in its strictest
sense. For its importance was such as to make it a synonym
for culture in general, and to leave us doubtful in some
cases whether Greek authors are speaking in this wider or
the narrower sense. But it is from music proper that they
all would start, as affording the central idea of education.</p>

<p>Here is one of the features in which Greek life is so different
from ours, that there is the greatest possible difficulty
in understanding it. When modern educators introduce
music into boys’ recreation time, and say it has important
influences in humanizing them, though in this they may approach
the language of Greek social reformers and statesmen,
they mean something widely different. The moderns
mean nothing more (I conceive) than this, that the practice
of music is a humane and civilizing pursuit, bringing boys
into the company of their sisters and lady friends, withdrawing
them from coarse and harmful pursuits, and thus
indirectly making them gentler and more harmless men.
It is as an innocent and social source of amusement that
music is now recommended. Let us put out of all account
the far lower and too often vulgar pressure on girls to learn
to play or sing, whether they like it or not. For here the
only advantage in view is not the girl’s moral or social improvement,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 61</span>
but her advancement in life, by making her attractive
in society. Such a view of musical training is
quite beneath any serious notice in the present argument.</p>

<p>What has above been said will be considered a fair statement
of the importance given to music by modern thinkers.
And accordingly, when we find all Greek educators
and theorists<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> asserting a completely different kind of importance
in music, we find ourselves in presence of what is
strictly an historical problem. It is not enough for the
Greeks to admit that martial music has strong effects on
soldiers going to battle, or that doleful music turns the
mind to sadness in a solemn requiem for the dead. They
went so far beyond this as to assert that by constantly
playing martial music people would become martial, that
by constantly playing and singing passionate and voluptuous
music people became passionate and voluptuous.
Consequently, the proper selection of instruments of music
and of words became a subject of serious importance. The
flute was cultivated at Athens till Alcibiades spurned it for
distorting his handsome face, and caused it to go out of
fashion at Athens. But this aversion to the Bœotian instrument
was supported by the theorists on the ground that
it had no moral tendency, that it was too exciting, and vague
in the emotions it excited; also, that it prevented the player
from singing words to his music.</p>

<p>But when we would infer from this that it is really the
text, and not the actual music, which has the mental effect—when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 62</span>
we are disposed to add that in our own time instrumental
music is a higher and more intellectual kind of
music, which has no moral effects save good ones, and that
it is the libretto of the opera or the sentiment of the song
which does harm—the answer from the Greek point of
view is conclusive against us. Though much stress was laid
upon the noble words which were sung, the music was
known to have the principal effect. Plato, in a celebrated
passage, even inveighs bitterly against the gross immorality
and luxuriousness of all mere instrumental music, which
allowed of so much ornament, so much exaggeration of expression,
so much complexity of emotion, as to be wholly
unsuited to his ideal state. It is, indeed, perfectly true that
the intellectual effort in understanding instrumental music,
at least some instrumental music, is far greater than is required
for appreciating, or imagining one appreciates, a simple
song. To understand a string quartet of Mendelssohn,
or, still more, a symphony of Beethoven, is an intellectual
task far exceeding the abilities of nine tenths of the audiences
who hear them.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> But, apart from all such intellectual
strain, there is a strong though indefinable passion about
this very music which has the deepest effects on minds
really tuned to appreciate it.</p>

<p>If this be too subtle an instance, there is another so
striking that it is worth mentioning on the chance of the
reader’s verifying it some day for himself. The Hungarian
gypsies who form the national bands are chiefly occupied
at entertainments in playing for the national dance—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 63</span>
<i lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">csárdás</i>—tunes which have now become familiar, some of
them, through the transcriptions of Liszt and Johannes
Brahms. The dance consists in a gradually increasing excitement,
starting from a slow and grave beginning. The
change is produced merely by increase of time in often repeating
the same air,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and also in adorning it with flourishes,
which are added <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</i> and somewhat barbarously, by
the members of the band according to their taste. The
effect of this gradual hurrying and complicating of the
same tune is inexpressibly affecting to the mind. It represents
excitement, and often voluptuous excitement, to the
highest degree. It would have thoroughly shocked Plato
and his school.</p>

<p>This simpler example, though less easily verifiable to the
English reader, is really more to the point, for there can be
no doubt that it is owing to the increase of complication,
and the growth of the intellectual combinations in music,
that we have lost sight of what the Greeks thought so vital—the
direct moral effects of music.</p>

<p class="sp1"><a id="sect43"></a>§ 43. The question remains, What did the Greeks convey
by this theory? Were they talking nonsense, or was
their music so different from ours that their theories have no
application in our day? We cannot adopt either of these
solutions, though all our researches into Greek scales, and
into the scanty examples of tunes still extant, are unable to
show clearly what they meant. We cannot make out why
tunes in the Doric scale—a scale varying slightly from our
ordinary minor scale—should be thought manly and moral,
while Lydian measures—a scale like our ordinary major
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 64</span>scales—should be thought immoral.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> We must give up the
problem of finding out a solution from the Greek scales.
But this we may fairly assert, that our music, being directly
descended from the old Church scales, which again were
derived from the Greek, cannot be so totally different from
that of the old Greeks as to warrant the inference that
theirs could be moral or the reverse, and ours indifferent to
morals. We may depend upon it that they did not talk
nonsense, and that the general consent of all their thinking
men on this curious point is well worthy of our most
serious attention.</p>

<p>It is probable that the far greater complexity of our
music, the multiplication of instruments, the development
of harmony, has brought out intellectual instincts unknown
to them, and so obscured the moral questions once so striking.
The Chinese of the present day, who have a music
far simpler than ours, mostly on the tetratonic scale, are
said to speak of the moral influence of music as the Greeks
did, and to put the composing and circulating of tunes under
a certain control. They used to have state composers
charged with this duty, in order to preserve and improve
the morals of the people. Although, then, it seems that the
simpler the character of a national music, the more clearly
its moral effects are perceived, we only want a closer analysis
to detect the same qualities in our own composers.
Much of the best music we now hear is unduly exciting: it
feeds vain longings, indefinite desires, sensuous regrets; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 65</span>
were the evidence stated in detail, the sceptical reader might
be convinced that here we are far behind the Greek educators,
and that we often deliberately expose our children
to great moral risk by inciting them to express their semi-conscious
desires in affecting music. The majority who
have no soul for music may be safe enough (though this is
not certain); but those whose soul speaks through their
fingers, or their voice, are running a very serious danger, of
which there is not the least suspicion among modern educators.
To seek corroboration from the characters of leading
musicians were invidious, but not without instruction.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 66</span>This inquiry is no digression which requires apology.
It is a point in which we do not seem to have reflected as
deeply as the ancients, and which is well worth discussing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 67</span>
without pedantry or sentimentality. It is also true that
the general aspect of this side of Greek education is more
interesting and fruitful than the inquiry into the structures
of the particular instruments they used—an antiquarian
question very minutely discussed by learned historians of
music, and by compilers of archæological lore. On these
details we may here be brief. The subject has been exhausted
by Mr. Chappell, our best historian of music.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 44. In education we never hear of the use of those
more complicated instruments, such as the <span title="trigônon" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρίγωνον</span>, or
harp, the double flute and others, which were used by professionals.
On the other hand, the favorite syrinx, or pandean-pipe,
was only in fashion among shepherds, and not
in schools. We may assume that nothing was there admitted
but the simplest form of stringed instrument, the
lyre (<span title="lyra" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λύρα</span>), which was originally made by stretching strings
across the inside of the back shell of a tortoise. These
shells are often to be found dry and clean in river-courses
through Greece. The tortoise when dead is eaten out by
ants or other insects; the shells separate, and are carried
away and cleaned by floods. This most primitive kind
was, however, supplanted by a more elaborate form, which
used the two shells of the tortoise, and fastened, in the position
of its front legs, a pair of goat’s horns, which were
spanned near their extremity by the <span title="zygon" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζύγον</span>, or yoke, to
which strings were drawn from the far end of the shell,
over the nether surface, or breast shell, which was flat.
This, with seven or at most ten strings, was the ordinary
instrument used to teach Greek boys to play. The more
elaborate cithara, which still survives, both in name and
structure, among the Tyrolese, was a lyre with a sound-box
built of thin wood or metal plates, and elongated into hollow
arms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 68</span> (where the lyre only had horns, or solid wooden
arms), so that the resonance was considerably greater. This,
in the form called <span title="pêktis" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πηκτίς</span>, had fifteen or more strings, and
does not here concern us. The use of the bow for stringed
instruments was unknown to the Greeks, but they used
for playing the <i>plectrum</i>, which is still used by the Tyrolese
for their <i>zither</i>.</p>

<p>The favorite wind-instrument was not our flute, which
was called <span title="plagiaulos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πλαγίαυλος</span>, or “cross-played aulos,” and which
was not popular, but our clarinet, the <span title="aulos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὐλός</span>, which was
held straight, was wide at the mouth, and produced its tone
by means of a vibrating tongue in the mouthpiece. The
ordinary aulos was played without any artificial aid; but
for the double aulos, where two reeds of different pitch
were blown from the same mouthpiece, a leather bandage
was tied over the player’s mouth, into which the mouthpiece
was fitted. This was the most extreme form of that
disfigurement of which the Greeks complained in flute-playing.</p>

<p>The tunes taught to boys are now lost, and we cannot
hope to reproduce them. But there is good reason to
think that they would not suit the developed taste of our
day, and would be considered dull and even ugly. This
we may infer from the few extant fragments of Greek
tunes.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47" class="label">[47]</a> It is not difficult for a man who has devoted sufficient time to
music, and has known many musical people, to find some analogy to
Dorian, Phrygian, and Lydian modes, as moral agents, in our modern
music. For surely the real meaning, the real depth, in the art is
this: that it represents, and by representing stimulates within us,
various emotions. Like all the other faculties of man, the emotions
are a great class of mental phenomena improved and strengthened
by a certain quantity of stimulus, but exaggerated and injured by being
overstrained, or too perpetually exercised. And it is the peculiar
province of music to awaken emotions too subtle and various for the
coarser utterance of words, and therefore to fill the mind with feelings
delightful, indeed, and deep, but from their very nature unutterable
in words and inexplicable except by sympathy. You cannot convey
to an unmusical man what is called the expression of an air—that
is to say, the emotion it has caused within you. Let us add that if you
could explain it, it would not have the distinctive value which it really
possesses. It is this very feature in the question which has caused the
moral effects of music to be wholly overlooked in a cold and logical
age, when many men are not affected by it, and in which everything
inexplicable by direct statement is likely to be considered unreal.</p>

<p>The emotions, then, which it is the proper object of music to stimulate,
are of that subtle character that they cannot be defined. Different
composers will, no doubt, excite a different <em>complexion</em> of feeling
in the mind. The works of Handel and J. S. Bach produce
a thoroughly satisfied and cheerful temper, even when they treat sad
subjects; whereas Beethoven has almost always about him that profound
melancholy which is to a mind in distress more sustaining in
its sympathy than all the comfort of consolation. But this only describes
the general character of the emotions produced, and not the
emotions themselves. For these are often not consciously before us
at all, but influence us, like our prejudices, from a hidden vantage-ground
within the soul.</p>

<p>But, alas! the history of this delicious stimulant is like that of all
the rest. Men begin to crave for it, and then constantly pursue it;
they will not be satisfied without stronger doses, and, presently, even
these cease to have their effect except by intoxication. In such case,
the stimulant is no longer applied to exciting an emotion, but to
satisfying a passion. And this latter differs from the former in being
more violent (being, perhaps, compounded of several emotions),
and in containing some coarser bodily element, either consciously or
unconsciously.</p>

<p>It may be illustrated from what are called sentimental songs. If
we compare the old chaste love-songs that are found among the
national melodies of England, and still better of Ireland, with the
love-songs in one of the greatest of modern operas, Gounod’s “Faust,”
the distinction will be easily apprehended. When an Irish girl puts
sweet wild music to the words of her song, and is then better satisfied
with it than if she merely spoke it, the reason is this, that there are
in her love a number of tender emotions, far too subtle to be uttered
in the words, but which are conveyed in the expression of the melody.
The very same may be said of the solemn, almost religious love-songs
of the old Italian composers, in which knightly reverence for the
gentler sex is so apparent. Let the soberest critic compare this
music with the splendid duet in the garden scene of Gounod’s
“Faust,” and more especially with the concluding song of the
act (that in six flats). Expressive this music is beyond description,
and expressive of love; but how different!</p>

<span class="fs75">THE LAST STAGE OF EDUCATION—MILITARY TRAINING OF THE EPHEBI.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="sp1">§ 45. The small size and narrow bounds of Greek states
made the support of a professional army seldom possible,
and accordingly we find expedients now suddenly again
become fashionable from very different causes—a citizen
army, and general liability to military service. No Greek
boy was allowed to pass from his school-days into citizen
life without some preliminary training and practice in the
use of arms and in military discipline. This is the discipline
of the <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">ephebi</i>, or grown-up boys, concerning which so
much has been written of late years by the learned. A
number of inscriptions regarding the duties and ceremonies
to be performed by them have been lately discovered, and
we seem to see in them a sort of general agreement throughout
Greece, rather differing in the time allotted, and in other
details, than in principles.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> There were actual masters in
the art of using arms, so far as this was not included in the
gymnastic exercises of the palæstra; we do not hear, however,
of much drilling, and probably the drill of Greek armies,
if we except the Spartans, was very imperfect in the
best period. It was not until the growth of mercenary armies,
and (almost simultaneously) the great military outburst
at Thebes under Epaminondas, that war became a
science in our sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 70</span>On the other hand, all the patrol duty of the frontier
was done by these <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">ephebi</i>, who, at about the age of sixteen,
were brought into the rank of citizens by a solemn service
and sacrifice, at which they swore oaths of fidelity and patriotism,
and undertook their military duties as a preliminary
to their full life of political burgesses. The orphans
of citizens killed in battle had their arms and military dress
presented to them (at Athens) by the State. The youths
assumed the short dark-gray cloak (<span title="chlamys" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χλαμύς</span>), and the broad-brimmed
soft hat (<span title="petasos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πέτασος</span>), suitable for marching duty,
and then, as <span title="peripoloi" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περίπολοι</span>, or patrolling police, they looked to
the safety of the country, the condition of the roads, and
occupied the frontier forts, of which we see such striking
remains still in Attica. The mountain fort of Phylæ, that
of Dekelea, of Œnoe (or Eleutheræ), of Sunium, of Thorikos,
of Oropos, and others, were the stations from which
the frontiers were patrolled.</p>

<p>It is doubtless owing to this precaution that, though we
read of insecurity in the streets of Athens by night, we
never read of brigandage through the country. Some
scholars have, indeed, asserted that the <span title="peripoloi" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περίπολοι</span> had police
duty to perform in the city, and at the public assembly.
This we need not accept; though on solemn occasions,
and when a great ceremony was to be held, they appeared,
not only to preserve order, but to participate in the
show. It is the latter duty which we see them performing
in the famous friezes of the Parthenon, which represent
the Panathenaic procession. They were allotted a separate
place in the theatre, and were in every respect regarded as
a distinct order in the State, the hope and pride of their
city, and its ornament on all stately occasions.</p>

<p>Their patrol duty on the frontier was appointed to them
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 71</span>for divers reasons. They attained through it the discipline
of arms, and learned some of the hardships of campaigning.
They learned an accurate knowledge of the roads
and ways through their country, and of the nature of their
frontier, and that of their neighbors. They were kept away
from the mischiefs which threaten youths of their age in
every city.</p>

<p>But the Athenians and other Greeks were careful not to
commit the mistake of which we now hear so much—that
of expecting these youths under twenty to face the enemy
in battle. They were specially reserved for garrison duty,
and one of Myronides’ victories was particularly noted,
because he fought it with these boys, who were not expected
to stand firm in the horrors of a battle.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 46. According to the words of the oath, indeed, as preserved
by Stobæus and Pollux, the standing firm beside
one’s comrade is specially mentioned; but even if this interesting
document be not spurious, as Cobet supposes,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
this particular declaration may be considered prospective,
and applying to the remainder of the citizen’s life. I add
the words here for the benefit of those who have not the
Greek text at hand: “I will never disgrace these hallowed
weapons, or abandon my comrade, beside whomsoever I am
placed, and I will fight for both sacred and common things
personally and with my fellows. I will not leave my country
less, but greater and better by sea and land, than I may
have received it. I will obey the rulers for the time being,
and obey the established laws, and whatsoever others the
commonwealth may agree to establish; and if any one
abolish the ordinances or disobey them, I will not allow it,
but will defend them personally and with the rest. I will
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 72</span>obey the established religion. Be my witnesses Aglauros,
Enyalios, Ares, Zeus, Thallo, Auxo, Hegemone.” Though
Cobet be right that some features of this oath can hardly
have been generally used through the course of Athenian
history, and that it was probably made up at a late period,
the list of gods, so curious and unlike what a late pedant
would invent, points to some old source; and perhaps there
are other really historical traditions in it.</p>

<p>The <em>general</em> authenticity of this text has rather been
confirmed by the discovery of the oath of the ephebi of
Dreros (near Knossus) in Crete—an inscription of undoubted
authenticity. Here, there are not only the general
declarations of loyalty and patriotism, but special oaths
to support the allied Knossus, and declarations of hatred
and hostility against the town of Lyttos.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> This formal
declaration of hatred may be compared with the outspoken
aristocratic oath quoted by Aristotle: “I will be ill-disposed
to the demos, and will do it whatever harm I can
devise.”</p>

<p>The various religious ceremonies connected with the admission
to the status of an ephebus, which was considered
distinct both from a boy and from a man—the sacrifices,
the cutting of the long hair (except in Sparta), the solemn
assembly of relatives, remind us strongly of the <em>confirmation</em>
of the Christian Church, to which it is the heathen
parallel.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 47. What a solemn procession of ephebi must have
been is best shown by the equestrian and sacrificial procession
on the frieze of the Parthenon. We notice some
young men naked, some in the short cloak and hat, riding
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 73</span>horses and leading victims. The riding of the horses was
not so easy as with us, for, in the first place, they had no
saddles and stirrups, and, in the second, it was thought necessary
for a good display to have the horse continually on
his hind-legs. A quiet walking horse in a procession was
thought very tame by the Greeks. Hence the management
of these curvetting and caracoling steeds must have
necessitated careful training in their riders. Again, we
find others leading bulls to the sacrifice, and the frequent
mention of contests with bulls has even misled many authorities
to imagine that the Attic ephebi practised bull-fighting.
The fact is that an unruly victim was of evil
omen, and hence the careful leading of these beasts, with
skill and strength combined, so as to make a proper part of
a great show, came under ephebic training. This, too, we
see on the Parthenon frieze. Wherever, in fact, any public
display was required, the artistic taste of the Greeks ordained
that the fairest and most stalwart men should be
there to adorn it; and as nothing is so beautiful as a crowd
of vigorous fresh youths, in the bloom of life and the happiness
of youth, we can conceive how splendid was a State
procession then compared with those of our day, when the
grandest show is one of old generals, effete officials, and
other venerable but decrepit magnates, who must be covered
with fine clothes, brilliants, and orders to prevent their
real ugliness and decay from being painfully obtrusive. In
Roman days we hear of these youths being employed as
guards of honor when distinguished foreigners visited
Athens.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 48. Though this ephebic training is spoken of as universal—and
it seems that after his inscription into the <em>register</em>
(<span title="lêxiarchikon grammateion" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ληξιαρχικὸν γραμματεῖον</span>) of his deme, which was his patent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 74</span>of citizenship, every Athenian lad was bound to serve as <em>patroller</em>
(<span title="peripolos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περίπολος</span>) and undergo his military training—there
must have been many exceptions; and, indeed, this whole education
is evidently that of the higher classes, and unsuitable
for the poor. In Roman days, we even find strangers coming
to Athens and enrolling themselves among the ephebi, as
those wealthy foreigners who understand what culture means
often send their sons to England to receive the unique
training of the English public schools. But this points to
its being a privilege, a special and much-prized education,
though we do not know what restrictions there were, or
how the sons of poorer men, who could not afford the time
and outlay, avoided it. The number of official ephebi was
never, I fancy, large, and always a class from which Phidias
might well select for his models, when seeking for ideal
types of youth and manliness.</p>

<p>It has, indeed, not been sufficiently noticed, in the various
essays on this ephebic training, that the very idea of such
a class never occurs in Herodotus or in Thucydides, though
it does in Xenophon;<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and if Plutarch speaks of Alcibiades
influencing the ephebi in the gymnasia with his wild
schemes of western conquest, we may be sure the historian
transferred the titles and notions of his age to older times.
In the third century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, there are so many inscriptions
about this class extant that it must have assumed a most
prominent place in Attic life. From that time onward
into Roman times, we hear of it constantly, and from many
sources. It is impossible that Socrates and his school should
not have alluded to it, had it already formally existed. We
may therefore infer that though its component parts—the
formal enrolment and sacrifices at a certain age, the patrol
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 75</span>duties, the gymnastic and musical training, the procession
duty at festivals—were developed in the best period of
Attic history, their official reduction to a State system
of education could not have taken place till later, till the
decay of practical public life had given men time to theorize
about methods of restoring by education what was
irreparably lost.</p>

<p>Apparently, the earliest <em>formal</em> notice is in a fragment
of the orator Lycurgus, who, in his famous speech on his
own management of the Athenian exchequer, alluded to
the statue of a certain Epicrates, which had been set up in
bronze <i>on account of his law about the ephebi</i>. We cannot
tell whether this was a special enactment or not. But it
<em>may</em> have been the very law which established this famous
system, so praised and sought after by all the Hellenistic
world in Roman days. If so, the establishment
would date from the very time when it proved of little real
importance to the history of Attica or of the world.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the many inscriptions reveal to us certain
curious and interesting features, which make us approve of
the good taste of Cicero and his friends, when they sent
their boys away from Rome to Athens, as we send our
sons to schools in England. Thus the learned Germans
who have investigated with great pains the various titles
of the magistrates or dignitaries among these ephebi are
often at a loss to determine whether they are masters set
over them, or leaders among the ephebi themselves. Indeed,
the so-called <span title="archôn tôn ephêbôn" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄρχων τῶν ἐφηβῶν</span> (head of the ephebi)
appears to have been no other than the most successful
and brilliant youth, the representative and spokesman of
the rest, like the senior prefect at some of our public
schools. No doubt, learned men who, in future ages, investigate
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 76</span>the ephebic training of the English will puzzle
themselves over the senior prefect at Winchester, and wonder
whether he was a master or a boy; and, if a boy, how
he could have so much power intrusted to him. We also
find that the expenditure of keeping up the solemn processions
and public contests was so great that the ephebi
themselves were encouraged to contribute largely; and if
they were rich, they gained an importance disproportionate
(we may suspect) to their age. What is even more interesting
to English students is that they had independent
clubs and associations, and even held solemn meetings,
where they used the terms of public life, and entitled the
resolutions (<span title="psêphismata" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ψηφίσματα</span>) enacted in their assembly (<span title="agora" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγορά</span>)
laws (<span title="nomoi" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νόμοι</span>). They had archons, strategi, agoranomi, and
even areopagites in these associations of youths. It must
have been with the approval of these formal meetings that
the gymnastic side of the ephebic training became gradually
discredited. Whether the dislike of great generals
like Alexander and Philopœmen to athletics contributed
to change public opinion, we cannot tell. But I confess to
feeling a considerable sympathy with the reform which asserted
the superiority of hunting and riding to the exercises
of the gymnasium—a change which is regarded by
some German critics as a melancholy sign of degradation.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 49. In these later days, when the seven subjects of
knowledge, including rhetoric, philosophy, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>, were formally
adopted, the ephebic training assumed the character of
a university course. There were, indeed, masters appointed
for fencing, the use of arms, dancing, and wrestling, as of
old; but the leading philosophical schools did not then
carry off the youths from the ephebic training; they rather
supplied it with formal professors. In the better and strictly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 77</span>classical days, before we hear of the technical term <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">ephebi</i>,
the practical training of the youths for patrols, and then as
incipient citizens, rather corresponded to what we call the
sixth form at a public school, and did not embrace really
philosophic teaching, such as is supposed to be found at
our universities. It had the same mixture of the physical
and intellectual, the same attention to mere accomplishments,
the same careful surveillance which we practise in
schools, but which are not a complete introduction to full
citizen life. This was the summit of Spartan training,
where the object was not to train really political men able
to discuss public affairs and assist in the government of the
State, but brave soldiers, and fine men, physically able to endure
hardship and submit to strict discipline. Something
quite different and intellectually higher was needful for a
really democratic life, for an intelligent understanding of
State functions, and the proper discussion of them. It was
all very well to dance complicated figures with grace, to
play the lyre and sing sweetly with it, to wrestle and run
with force and ease. This was the old training, which made
fine soldiers, but good citizens only in the sense of stupidly
ignorant, and therefore obedient, hearers of the orders of
their superiors. The necessity of a change came with the
rise of democracy in Greece, and the Greeks provided
themselves, when the need arose, with teachers suited to
their wants. These men, the Sophists, were the first who
gave any education corresponding to our university courses,
and to these we now turn.</p>

<span class="fs75">HIGHER EDUCATION—THE SOPHISTS AND SOCRATES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="sp1">§ 50. As every one knows now, the real position and
merits of the Sophists were first brought to light by Grote
in his monumental “History of Greece.” Since the publication
of that book the English scholar has learned that
sophist, in early Greek history, is not synonymous with liar
and villain, undermining public morals and sapping religion.
Within the last few years the influence of this new
view is gradually reaching the Germans, a nation not very
ready to adopt, in philology at least, English opinions.
But this very natural reluctance has its exceptions; for in
the most important new book on the history of Greek
philosophy, Zeller’s last edition, we find that, in spite of
sundry reservations, the main results of Grote’s investigations
are recognized and adopted.</p>

<p>Before I go on to appropriate from these authors that
part of their account of the Sophists which belongs properly
to the subject of Greek education, it is worth reflecting
a moment on so very remarkable an instance of misunderstood
evidence as this controversy exhibits. The
main body of philologists simply followed like a flock of
sheep Plato’s and Aristotle’s polemic against their own rivals.
Plato inherited from Socrates a strong antipathy to
these practical and often utilitarian teachers. But it was
for the most part the same sort of antipathy that the solid
university professor of our own day has for the successful
crammer. The competition mania of the present day has
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 79</span>created a demand for these specialists, who do not profess
anything more than their special trade of passing men for
examinations, and who do it admirably, and derive from it
large emoluments. So the rise of democratic institutions,
and the spread of international debates, made the fifth century
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> in Greece one that required suddenly a set of practical
teachers for men who practised at the bar or debated
in the public assembly. We are too much in the habit of
thinking that such men required training merely in rhetoric—in
the way of disputing and of plausibly stating their
views. They required more; they required education in
general subjects, and of course not a deep education, but
such a one as would enable them to talk intelligently,
and make and understand allusions to the deeper questions
of the day. We hear that now in America it is not an
uncommon thing for men who have risen suddenly in the
world, and for their wives, to send for a teacher and say,
“I am now in a position to move in educated society, and
to be required to speak on public affairs. My early training
was entirely neglected. I want you to instruct me in
the ordinary topics of the day, as well as in those points of
art and science which may be serviceable for my purpose.”
And such instruction, very superficial, no doubt, and inaccurate,
but highly practical, is often given.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 51. Now, let us imagine that an intelligent Greek or
other foreigner, totally unacquainted with modern journalism,
were to seek for evidence of its moral value and the
real benefits it confers upon us. What answer would he
receive? If he applied to the journalists themselves, they
would tell him that it was their object so to furnish their
readers with all the current topics of instruction as to make
them able to converse intelligently without any further
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 80</span>study. They would also profess to be leaders of the moral
sense of the public, praising what was of good repute, and
blaming the wicked, exposing abuses, and expounding virtue.
They would also claim the merit of supplying the
public with arguments in favor of a disputed conclusion,
so that men might be furnished with weapons to meet their
intellectual adversaries. He would naturally ask, on hearing
this exalted programme, whether all this was done out
of pure philanthropy or with any ulterior view; more especially,
whether there was any pecuniary gain attached.
They would reply that they did indeed take money for
their teaching—and the laborer is worthy of his hire—but
they would appeal to any of their readers whether the instruction
afforded was not greatly in excess of their remuneration.
With this reply our stranger might perhaps be
but half satisfied, and might have some suspicion that independent
evidence would not come amiss; and on inquiring
from thoughtful men what emoluments were to be
gained by this profession, he would hear that, if successful,
it was one of the most lucrative known, and that many of
the contributors confessedly worked, not for the sake of
conviction, but of gain. He would next inquire whether
success was always in their case a test of solid merit,
and would discover that, however it might be so intellectually,
from a moral point of view such was not the case.
The most thoughtful and candid members of our society
would explain to him that, here as elsewhere, men delighted
more in reading what fell in with their prejudices than
what exposed them, and that by pandering to this defect,
and following in the wake of public opinion, newspapers
often succeeded better than by honest and fearless teaching.
He would hear that almost every paper belonged to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 81</span>some political party, whose errors and weaknesses it felt
bound to justify and protect. Furthermore, that for the
sake of clearness and of brevity, as well as from a want of
care to do more than please for the hour, many arguments
in the daily papers were superficial and illogical, not
clearing, but obscuring, the real questions at issue. He
would certainly, therefore, in the course of his inquiry,
come to look upon them as a class or profession; but yet,
if he spoke of them as such, he might be surprised to hear
himself corrected by the journalists or by their friends.
They would deny that they were a distinct profession, and
say with truth that <em>all</em> intelligent men who desired to teach
were to some extent journalists, who are marked by no
fixed principle, by the bonds of no special education. Even
their own critics, he would hear with surprise, at times
joined them and wrote to instruct the public. They were
a class and not a class, a profession and not a profession;
with a common object, to some extent a common method,
but hardly any common principles, any direct co-operation,
any common interest, to outbalance their jealous rivalry.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 52. Is this a fair picture of the moral side of journalism?
It is obtained simply by describing, in the wake of
Plato and of Mr. Grote and of Sir Alexander Grant, the old
Greek Sophists. These, then, were really the Greek journalists,
who, before the days of posts and printing, carried
about from city to city the latest news, the most recent
criticism, the most modern views of politics and of education,
the newest theories on morals and on religion. It
may be thought irreverent to compare St. Paul to our
daily press, but I cannot better explain myself than by
pointing to that most graphic scene in the Acts where the
apostle arrives at Athens. He is seized by the eager and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 82</span>curious public as we seize the precious journal in some remote
country place when we have been separated from the
current of affairs for a few days. And, no doubt, they first
asked him what local or political information he had
brought from his previous sojourn, just as we first read the
messages from Paris or London; and when this curiosity
was satisfied, they began to inquire what more he had to
say; and, finding that he was an ethical teacher, or sophist,
they proceeded at greater leisure to enjoy the rest of his
communications, just as we should turn on to the leading
article, the correspondence about ritualistic innovations, or
the reviews. St. Paul was taken for a sophist, and justly
so in some sense, for he taught morals and religion; still
more, he taught a new religion. We all know how far he
differed from that class. Flippant, plausible, ingenious,
sceptical, they were the idols of the public, but the aversion
of those deeper minds to whom the ignorance and prejudice
of the masses are not a source of material gain, but
rather a grievous and galling spiritual burden.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 53. This is what the Greek Sophists really were, crammers
not for special competitions, but for the general requirements
of higher society and of political life. They
crammed more or less honestly, more or less efficiently, for
a generation or two. Then the want of them passed away,
as we may hope the want of the modern crammer will pass
away with the superstition that we can find out practical
merit by mere examinations. At Athens and throughout
Greece the encyclopædic teaching of the Sophists was presently
carried into minute specialty by teachers of rhetoric,
of dialectic, and of morals, just as the professors of geology
of thirty years ago are being supplanted by special teaching
in fossil anatomy, botany, and mineralogy. From the middle
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 83</span>of the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> the Sophists disappear as a
class altogether. It is, nevertheless, certain that they left
no bad name behind them in Greece, except among the
immediate followers of Plato and Aristotle; for in the second
century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> the title was revived as one of the highest
honor, and attaching to the greatest literary post in
Athens.</p>

<p>We need not assert that these teachers were as strictly
business-like as the modern <em>coach</em>, or that they confined
themselves as strictly to their definite object. They often
boasted of great performances which were beyond the reach
of ordinary people, and were merely meant for display.
But then their aims were far wider and more varied than
those of the coach, and were not to be tested by the clear
and definite result of the examination lists. Hence Plato
and Socrates found it easy to pick holes in their programmes,
and to accuse them of getting money under false
pretences. These philosophers went further, and reviled
them for taking money at all, bartering their wisdom for
gold, and imparting virtue for a fee. All this was mere
jealous polemic, and based on an unfair estimate of the attempt
made by practical men to supply a public want. Yet
even though Plato himself paints the leading Sophists as
most respectable men, though we know from independent
evidence that they were so, whether Plato confessed it or
not, the attacks on the profession made by him and by
Aristophanes—the one a radical reformer, and the other a
blind conservative—have so imposed upon the learned that
they have completely mistaken the real evidence on the
question, and set down the arguments for the prosecution
as if they were a judicial charge or a mature verdict. So
powerful is the influence of literary skill, when it causes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 84</span>the survival of a single work amid the loss of all its fellows.
Because Plato is our leading witness on the Sophists,
because Aristophanes’ satire has survived, men imagine that
this must be the general verdict, and set down the bias
and the prejudice of an individual as the reflex of public
opinion.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 54. These men really shaped out the first form which
university education took in Europe, meaning by university
education that higher general training which, coming after
school discipline, trains men for the duties of social and
political as well as scientific and literary life.</p>

<p>In the city life of the Greeks, when residence in any
foreign place entailed great inconvenience, it was evident
that this university teaching could not occupy a fixed
place. It was not till the amalgamation of the Greek nation
under Roman sway that Athens became (like Alexandria)
strictly a university town. So, as the students could
not gather round the early sophist, he was obliged to go to
them, wandering through Greece, and staying for a considerable
time in each great centre, where the native youth
could profit by him. But even in early days there were
some enthusiastic pupils, who abandoned home and country,
and wandered about as aliens in the wake of these
brilliant teachers. The latter generally made high display
of their acquirements, and gave exhibitions of eloquence
and of argument to show the value of their wares. They
lived an ostentatious life, like the professional artists of
the present day, and though they made large profits, saved
but little money. Their first object was to make ready
and practical citizens, men able to collect and express their
thoughts and give sound advice on public matters. For
this purpose they not only taught the art of rhetoric and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 85</span>that of disputation, but they were obliged to enter upon
some of the great theories which form the basis of all practical
life—the problems of philosophy, of ethics, and of religion.
As we might expect, they took in all these a
utilitarian view, such as a practical crammer would take.
Some of them, such as Gorgias and Protagoras, studied
philosophy deeply, but only to show that a devotion to
metaphysic or to abstract science was idle, all knowledge
being subjective, and varying with the age. Man was the
measure of things; abstract nature was mere nothing. On
the more pressing question of morals, though practically
sound enough, and though some of them, such as Prodicus,
were celebrated as moral preachers, they denied all immutable
morality, and were content with obeying the existing
laws of society, without admitting any permanent scientific
basis for them. It was Socrates who first applied his great
mind to solve this question, and his classes of young men—he
was in this a regular sophist or university teacher,
and was commonly so called—were specially exercised in
seeking for the permanent and immutable ideas implied
in our moral terms which characterize our moral actions.
As regards religion, seeing that the Greek faith had grown
up in myths and poetry, and was imbedded in an elaborate
polytheistic mythology full of immoralities and absurdities,
the Sophists were, as we might expect, sceptical,
and so far opposed to the conservative public. One of
them, Protagoras, actually professed his unbelief in the national
faith, and was persecuted accordingly; others, though
more cautious, and regarding any formal denial of transcendental
truths as hardly practical, were justly suspected
of agnosticism, as their moral essays kept suspiciously
clear of theology. They were regarded as unsound in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 86</span>faith, and hence alleged to be unsound in morals by the
orthodox, whose faith the Sophists charged fairly enough
with the same objection.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 55. So the education of the Sophists came to be regarded
by the soberest part of the public, the steady-going
old people, as subversive of ancient and venerable
traditions. In religion it was supposed to suggest, if not
to teach, infidelity; in politics and society, radicalism.
This is exactly the sort of charge we hear made by the old-fashioned
public against the universities—still more in
Germany, where the gulf between the average and the learned
part of society is far wider than it is here. When we
university teachers make young men think, even though
carefully avoiding (as we are in honor bound) anything
which may shock the traditions in which they have been
brought up, the mental agitation produced must, nevertheless,
lead them to reject at least some superstitions which they
have accepted on weak evidence. If our education does not
produce this result, it is not worthy the name. But this
partial and cautious scepticism is of course identified by
the older generation, who are less spiritually developed,
with the rejection of vital truths. And there are many
cases where the young sceptic really oversteps his just
bounds, and becomes as rash in negation as his fathers
were uncritical in affirmation. Let us add that the orthodox
party are not very particular about evidence, and will
start a calumnious charge against a teacher whom they
suspect and fear, with very little care about really proving
their case. This party are, moreover, always supplied with
powerful allies by the jealousies and differences among
the teachers themselves, the elder and less able of whom
often try to sustain their waning influence by an alliance
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 87</span>with orthodoxy, and make up by theological popularity
what they have been unable to attain for want of intellectual
force and sympathy.</p>

<p>All these things, which now happen constantly in our
universities, are the exact counterparts of what happened
in Greece in the days of the Sophists. They taught clever
young men such surface-knowledge of science as disgusted
the deeper experts, and, what was more, they taught them
that the experts were pursuing a vain shadow, and attempting
insoluble problems. They taught them to avoid becoming
specialists, and to apply themselves to public life.
Just as the English universities can boast of many great
politicians and literary men, rather than of specialists in
the sciences, and as they might hold that to produce a
Gladstone or a Cornewall Lewis is better than to produce
a Faraday, so the Sophists made general culture their professed
object, and so far quarrelled with deeper philosophy.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 56. The same sort of proceeding in morals brought
them into contact with Socrates, whose daily teaching may
be regarded as the best university teaching of the day.
Socrates was in all external respects a sophist, and commonly
regarded as such. He did not, indeed, travel about,
being luckily a citizen of the largest and most enlightened
city in Greece. He despised, too, wealth and ostentation
of the ordinary kind, though he made himself no less remarkable
by his voluntary poverty. But in more important
respects, in despising abstract science and speculative
philosophy, and sifting traditional theories of morals and
society, in radically shaking up and often upsetting all
preconceived notions, Socrates was a sophist, and one of
the most dangerous of them. He sought, indeed, to do
what they had not done—to find some better and surer
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 88</span>positive basis for morals, but the negative part of his work
was far the most successful and striking. Hence the conservative
public at Athens not only suspected and disliked
him, but at the prosecution of their mouthpiece, Anytus, a
most respectable and earnest man, condemned him to death,
when he showed clearly that no verdict of theirs would restrain
him from pursuing his occupation. This sentence
on Socrates, which the orthodox party at Athens never regretted,
and even justified, should indeed be a warning to
those who calumniate their fellows in the interests of orthodoxy.
But with this we are not now concerned.</p>

<p>The higher teaching of the Sophists and of Socrates,
which was at best desultory, passed into the hands of successors
like Plato and Isocrates, who established regular
schools, and subjected their pupils to a regular course of
training. This was all the more necessary, as the training
given by Socrates had no definite limits, and his tendency
was to keep young men talking and discussing ethical problems
when they ought to have turned to practical life.
Leisure was, indeed, in such high repute among the old
Greeks that idleness was not reprehended as it should have
been. The orthodox party made this objection with much
force to the school or following of Socrates. In the case
of Plato there was a regular course of higher philosophy,
and his principal pupils became, in their turn, philosophic
teachers. But the school of Plato was even more than that
of Socrates a university training, for which there may even
have been a matriculation examination, if we adopt literally
the statement that no one was allowed to enter without
knowing elementary geometry. The great fault of Plato,
as of Socrates, was that he did not introduce men to
public or practical life, but made them philosophers or idlers.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 89</span>In science, indeed, this special training was of great service,
and the history of geometry would have been very different
without these speculators. But the Platonic pupil when
completely trained was professedly, according to the master
himself, disinclined to join in politics, and only to be persuaded
by his sense of duty and the willing obedience of
the public.</p>

<p>It is on account of the same sort of exclusiveness, even
monastic in its strictness, that the famous brotherhood of
Pythagoras deserves but a small place in any general history
of Greek education. Admission to this brotherhood
was only obtained through a strict novitiate, and the object
of it was to combine peculiar religious asceticism with
an aristocratic policy, and a sort of club life antagonistic
to ordinary society. We have, unfortunately, only few authentic
details concerning this sect, and know it best from
the few echoes of it in early, and the many in later, Platonism.
But it, too, may be regarded as a higher intellectual
or university training, combined with collegiate life
and its restraints, thus anticipating in spirit that feature
which makes the English universities so peculiar among
the modern seats of learning in Europe.</p>

<p>I will return to Plato and his followers when we come
to consider the theories of education which the philosophers
based on the phenomena of Greek history. And before
we pass from the Sophists to the Rhetors, and show a
further specializing of higher education in that direction,
we may say a word in conclusion on the external history
of these once celebrated, and since much-maligned, educators.
We hardly know them at all, save through their
enemies, the specialist philosophers and specialist rhetoricians;
and what we hear of them must be distrusted and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 90</span>sifted accordingly. Nevertheless, even from their enemies,
we learn that the three greatest of them—Protagoras,
Gorgias, and Prodicus—were eminently respectable and respected
men. So was the fourth in importance, Hippias,
though the encyclopædic pretensions he put forth to practise
all trades and manual dexterities, as well as philosophy,
history, and rhetoric, have left an unpleasant impression
against him. Nevertheless, he was honored at Elis, his
native place, as their leading citizen, and compiled for them
the annals of their famous past in such a way as to gain
universal acceptance.</p>

<p>As regards the other three, though they all professed to
impart general education, and to give their pupils that negative
training in philosophy which would arm them against
false theories, yet they were each remarkable for some special
line. Protagoras, apart from his famous philosophical
position of the relativity of knowledge to him who knows,
openly professed to teach <em>political</em> wisdom, and despised all
other kinds of knowledge in comparison with it. Gorgias,
on the other hand, though he wrote a famous treatise with
the very Hegelian title “concerning nature or the non-existent,”
devoted his main attention to <em>rhetoric</em>, and was
truly the father of technical Greek oratory. For though we
hear of Corax and Tisias in Sicily, and of Empedocles, as
having cultivated the art, the first recognized theorist and
practical speaker was Gorgias. He not only delivered set
speeches, but so trained himself as to deliver elegant discourses
on any proposed subject, apparently without preparation,
but of course with the help of a clever system of
well-arranged commonplaces, which he applied with quickness
and variety. The philosophy of Prodicus was chiefly
ethical, and his apologues were very popular and quoted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 91</span>in after-days. But more important were his <em>grammatical</em>
studies, whereby he fixed the parts of speech, and laid the
groundwork of the grammar of the modern languages of
Europe. Indeed, the strict attention to form shown by all
the Sophists led them to study language with peculiar care,
and they were the forefathers of modern philologists in
this as in some other respects.</p>

<p>A great many more Sophists are known by name, some
of them depicted or maligned in Plato’s dialogues, such as
Thrasymachus, Polus, Euenus; but they do not present to
us any special features. All are said to have insisted
on the dictates of society as superior to any supposed law
of nature, and this Hobbism has brought upon them the
anathemas of moralists. Within the century 470–370 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
their part was played out; and even Plato, in his later works,
no longer thinks them worthy of refutation.</p>

</div>

<p class="sp1">§ 57. It is argued by many scholars, who believe all that
Plato says literally, and who think that the dark pictures of
Thucydides apply only to his own day, and not to previous
generations, that the Greeks were so degraded and debauched
by this sophistic tampering with religion and
morals, by this scepticism in philosophy, and by the rise of
radicalism in politics, as to present from this time onward
(430 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) the symptoms of a decaying race. The Athenian
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 92</span>State, in particular, is supposed to have lost its splendor
and its seriousness, and to be now a mere mob-rule, far
removed from the democracy, tempered with despotism,
which made it so great under Pericles. This view, which
is strongly urged, for example, in Curtius’s “History of
Greece,” is based altogether on the complaints of Plato
and Aristophanes, and the impression produced by the history
of the aristocratic Thucydides, by Xenophon, and by
the plays of Euripides. This is not the place to refute the
theory generally, as has been done by Grote, who shows
that never was the Athenian democracy so enlightened and
moderate in policy as in the period after the close of the
great war (403 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>). But in the particular department before
us, that of education, we have already seen that this period
after the Peloponnesian war is exactly the period when
the sophistic higher education began to be discarded as superficial
and even morally questionable, and the task of training
the keener and more ambitious youth passed into the
hands of greater specialists—either philosophers like Plato
and his followers, or rhetoricians like Isocrates and Antiphon.
Socrates forms the connecting link between the
Sophists and the philosophic schools. Isocrates is hardly
such a link, though he professes to be the philosopher in
the guise of a rhetorician. Though he inveighed against
his rivals the Sophists, he is hardly to be distinguished
from them save in his being fixed at Athens, in his avoidance
of displays (from natural inability rather than from
choice), and in his declared conservatism in religion and
politics, as contrasted with their scepticism. It is not just
that the eminent respectability of Isocrates personally
should be urged as another difference, when we adopt the
fair view of the high characters of the leading Sophists.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 93</span>Isocrates, whose views are fortunately preserved in his own
very diffuse advocacy of them, was strictly a university
teacher; and so well recognized was this that <em>a pupil of
Isocrates</em> meant something like our A.B. Oxon. For he
had a regular course, and charged a considerable fee for
his lessons. His pupils came from all parts of Greece, and
stayed with him a considerable time. Moreover, he could
boast that the most famous public men had been educated
by him, and owned his influence in after-days. This
higher education he called <em>philosophy</em>, and he only differed
from other professed Sophists (he says) in the modesty
of his promises, and his distinct admission that he
undertook merely to improve natural talent, not to change
a stupid and ignorant youth into a man of acuteness and
power.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 58. There is an interesting passage in the speech in
vindication of his life,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> which gives so clear a view of the
prevailing opinions about higher education at Athens that
I will transcribe it freely:</p>

<p>“The ordinary attacks made upon us are of two kinds.
Some say that going to the Sophists for education is mere
arrant imposture; never has there been any system of
training discovered by which a man can become abler in
speech or wiser in deed, since all who excel in these respects
differ by nature from the rest of mankind. The
other objectors concede that those who submit to this
training become indeed abler, but in a bad sense, and coupled
with moral loss; for when they gain power, they use
it to injure their neighbors. I will now refute both these
objections.</p>

<p>“First, let us consider the absurdity of those who decry
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 94</span>all higher education. They revile it, indeed, as worth
nothing, and mere deceit and imposture, but yet demand
from us that our pupils, as soon as they come, should show
a complete change, that after a few days’ intercourse with
us they should appear better in discourse and abler than
their elders in age and experience; but if they stay one
whole year, they should all be perfect orators—the idle as
well as the diligent, the commonplace as well as the gifted.
This they expect from us, though we never have made
such promises, and though it contradicts the analogy of all
other kinds of training, in which results are acquired with
difficulty, and each with a various measure of success, so
that some two or three only out of all the schools of all
kinds turn out thoroughly proficient, while the rest remain
mere average amateurs. Accordingly, the objectors are
silly enough to demand from a training, which they call
unreal, an influence unknown in the recognized instruction
of all arts and sciences! Our teaching, then, is discredited
for accomplishing exactly what the other arts do. For
which of you does not know that many of those put under
the Sophists were not imposed upon, as is alleged, but
have become, some of them, real experts in public life,
others able instructors of youth, and even those who chose
to remain in private life more polished in manners than
they had been, and more accurate critics of arguments as
well as of most ordinary things?</p>

<p>“How, then, can a pursuit be fairly despised which has
produced such results? for do not all men confess this, that
those are to be esteemed the most thoroughly versed in
their art or handicraft who can make their apprentices as
good workmen as themselves? Now, in philosophy this
very thing has happened. For as many as happened on a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 95</span>genuine and sensible guide will be found to have such a
family likeness in their way of expressing themselves that
any one can tell they have come from the same trainer.
This similarity of type is conclusive evidence of the method
and system to which they have been subjected. So, too,
any of you could mention fellow-pupils who, as children,
were the most ignorant of their fellows, but as they advanced
in age became far superior in good sense and in
eloquence to those once far ahead of them.”</p>

<p>The orator goes on, with his usual elegant diffuseness,
to make many other developments of the same leading
idea, all of which might be used with hardly a word of
change by any one defending our university education
against the vulgar objectors who think that vast sums of
time and money are spent upon it, with little or no result.
Nor is the good which he does claim for his higher education
anything different from what our universities could
claim, apart from the material good of prizes and degrees.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 59. The peculiar position of Isocrates was that of opposition
to both Sophists and philosophers, and yet of
likeness to both. He joined the Sophists in urging sceptical
objections to the subtle theories of the metaphysicians,
and in commenting upon the small outcome of their
elaborate speculations. He joined the philosophers in attacking
the boastful claims of the Sophists, who pretended
to teach everything. But he joined with the more practical
side in putting a training in rhetoric—a training in
style—above everything. There were many reasons why
this should be the case with higher education at Athens.
In an age when books were scarce, and a reading public
small; when the power of publicism only existed for poets,
and when all State affairs were settled by discussion either
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 96</span>in the assembly or in private meetings—in such a society
a power of clear and elegant utterance was the highest
and best outcome of education. Nor could any man then
be considered educated who lacked that power, just as
nowadays no man is called educated who cannot write
correct English; and, furthermore, the writing of elegant
English is justly accounted to indicate a thorough and
general culture. For we are such severe judges in this
matter, everybody thinks himself in this so well able to
appreciate beauty and pick out defects, that a man who
can pass through the fire of criticism unscathed must indeed
be equipped with no ordinary preparation, and may
be pronounced a really cultivated man. This will explain
to us the enormous importance of rhetoric in Isocrates’
system—an importance, perhaps, enhanced by his feeling
that here he was really able to do great and unique
service. He evidently depended on natural mother wit
to suggest ideas to his pupils; he apparently assumed
that they had learned the ordinary elements of culture at
their primary schools. He trained them, so far as we know,
in nothing but the careful arrangement of their materials,
the smooth transition of their arguments, and the perfection
of their choice and collocation of words. In this
matter of style, Isocrates may be regarded as not only the
greatest master that ever lived, but as the father of the
periodic or oratorical style in all the languages of Europe.
Demosthenes, Cicero, St. John Chrysostom, Massillon, Burke—all
these immortal men have profited by the analysis of
expression which, through Isocrates, first formed Greek
prose, and through it the borrowed graces of those who
followed Greek models.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 60. To enter into a closer description of this system
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 97</span>would not be to discuss education, but rhetoric, and we
must refer the reader to treatises on that subject. We
need only here call attention to the intense <em>studiedness</em> of
Greek eloquence, and how they attained their perfection
in prose—not by those violations of propriety which now
please our sated taste, and which, when violent enough, as
in the case of Carlyle, even pass for thoughts, and are to
many the index of deep originality in something or other—but
by a close and perpetual adherence to rules, often
of a trivial, generally of a minute kind.</p>

<p>It is very curious for us moderns to read the details of
these things in the old rhetoricians. There is not an apparent
touch of nature—a word emphatically repeated, a
sudden break off, an angry burst, even a <i>don’t you see?</i> or
a <i>by Jove!</i> or a <i>dear me!</i>—in a Greek oration which was
not noted as a <i>figure of diction</i>, or a <i>figure of thought</i>,
and brought under the discipline of rules. We are even
told that Demosthenes composed his prose in rhythm, and
avoided the use of more than two short syllables together.
Isocrates certainly made the law against hiatus—against
closing a word and beginning the next with vowels—a law
adopted by all the prose writers of his age. Thus the
formal education in rhetoric must have been no light task
for the pupils of Isocrates and the other rhetors, and writing
or speaking good Greek a far stricter and more difficult
thing than writing English which will pass muster with
the critics.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 61. Still, there is room for surprise that the <em>matter</em> of
higher education, the ideas to be acquired, should have
been introduced indirectly under the guise of preparation
for public speaking. No doubt, this was an artificial and
unnatural order of things. To subordinate the matter of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 98</span>knowledge to the form is always a mistake. But we may
at least conceive the position of Isocrates’ pupils if we
compare it with that of the popular preachers, so powerful
a generation ago, and even now playing no unimportant
part in society. I have known more than one of these
eminent men who educated themselves with great care generally,
and in all directions, for the purpose of supplying
themselves with matter for their discourses. And this is
very well-meant, legitimate, and honest education, though
perverted in order, and, like that of Isocrates, not likely to
lead to really deep and thorough knowledge. We are told
that in the present day there are people who read all kinds
of books for the purpose of solving double acrostics, and I
have heard men of intelligence advocate this foolish kind
of riddles as promoting general education!</p>

<p>Thus the school of Isocrates stood side by side, and in
rivalry, with the schools of Plato and Aristotle, as one in
which elegance of form, and a superficial but graceful culture,
was given to the higher youth, instead of the exact
science and metaphysic which unfitted men for public life.
It was a contrast somewhat like the Oxford and Cambridge
type in England. Isocrates’ own failure as a politician,
and the little influence which his open letters on
politics attained, made the wiser portion of men drift away
still farther from the sophistic aspect of his teaching, from
the mixture of philosophy and politics with rhetoric; and
so they again subdivided their training into strictly rhetorical,
such as had already been begun by Lysias and was
carried out by Isæus, and the philosophical, for which an
increasing number of schools now offered themselves. As
the political power of Greece decayed, and its literary and
artistic splendor became universally recognized, Athens
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 99</span>became an educational centre, to which youths from all
parts of the civilized world flocked for their training.
This later history of Greek culture will occupy us in our
<a href="#ch11">last chapter</a>. But we must first give a brief account of the
deeper theories of State education which Plato and Aristotle
have left us, in contrast to the shallow popularity of
Isocrates.</p>

<span class="fs75">THE GREEK THEORISTS ON EDUCATION—PLATO AND ARISTOTLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="sp1">§ 62. It is usual in books on Greek education to give a
very large space to the discussion of the “Republic” and
“Laws” of Plato and the “Politics” of Aristotle, because
they contain elaborate and systematic recommendations as
to the training of youth. But the states of both philosophers
are ideal, Aristotle’s not less than Plato’s; and, though
the educational portion of Aristotle’s work seems fragmentary
and unfinished, we cannot hold that any further developments
would have brought it within the range of practical
politics. Plato’s notions were confessedly theoretical, and
are discussed as such by all his commentators; but some
scholars have given themselves endless trouble to find out
how much of his system, especially in the tamer and less
extravagant “Laws,” was borrowed from real life, and from
actual states, as opposed to the creations of his own fancy.
But in nearly every detail the distinction is purely conjectural.
It is really for want of positive evidence that these
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 100</span>theories have assumed such undue importance. To the
philosophical theorist and the educational reformer the
speculations of such splendid intellects in the early post-meridian
of the glorious day of Greece must ever be most
attractive and suggestive; but it is idle to transfer to a practical
book, or to an historical account, what has never been
realized.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> These speculations, however, may fairly find a
limited space here as showing what general effect the practical
education already described had produced upon the
most advanced thinkers of the day.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we have here again only the aristocratic
side, and that which would assert the State to be paramount
and all-interfering through individual and private
life. If we had the speculations of Lycophron and his
school, who held, with truly democratical instinct, that laws
were only useful to repress crime, and that the rest of the
citizen’s life was to be left free and uncontrolled, our notions
about the theories of Greek education might be considerably
modified. But, on the other hand, we have preserved
to us the Hellene of the Hellenes; the school of Lycophron
might only have recommended to us what we know
by practical experience in modern society.</p>

<p>From the very outset Plato and Aristotle adopt quite
definite principles. They assume that the State is to interfere
everywhere and control the whole life of man. Thus
the splendid Athenian democracy in which Plato lived had
no power to wean him from his somewhat narrow prejudices.
He despised the goods he possessed, and longed for
a Spartan ideal, though its defects were plain enough before
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 101</span>his eyes.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Still worse, the wide vista opened by Alexander
into a larger fusion of ideas, and into widely various
forms of society, had no power to emancipate the intellect
of Aristotle from its ingrained Hellenic narrowness. It is
necessary to make this strong protest at the outset, on account
of the chorus of admiration sung by the pedants and
pedagogues of modern days over these thoroughly unpractical
and retrograde theories. One fact will speak volumes
to the modern reader. Both of them look upon a small
number of citizens, and, indeed, a small limit of territory,
as essential to their schemes, no accurate or perpetual
supervision by State police and direction being possible
either in a great city or a large territory.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> This will in itself
show how antiquated they must have seemed even in
the next century, when the Greeks woke to the ambition
of ruling over kingdoms in the East.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 63. And yet there were some points on which these
thinkers, especially Plato, were far more thoroughgoing
than we are, chiefly from a total absence of that sentiment
or sentimentality which infects modern life. For Plato,
both in the “Republic” and the “Laws,” insists that education
will be of little avail if children are brought into the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 102</span>world deformed in body and warped in mind by the bad
physical and mental condition of their parents. On some
of these cases Greek society was agreed with him. In
most states a deformed child was exposed either to die or
to be picked up by some one who might run the risk of
bringing it up to make a household slave.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> For in most
states, and certainly at Sparta, it would have been held a
crime to propagate hereditary disease; and men were spared
the disgusting spectacle of the scrofulous or deaf-and-dumb
heir to a great name being courted in matrimony to perpetuate
the miseries or the vices of his progenitors.</p>

<p>But Plato went further, and held that the production of
the most important animal, man, should be regulated with
even more care than that of the lower animals, in which
such striking results have been obtained by artificial selection.
He therefore recommended, in his ideal State,
not community of wives—Heaven forbid that we should
follow Aristotle in repeating this gross libel!—but a careful
State selection of suitable pairs, and their solemn union,
under the guise of a direction from Providence by an
appeal to the lot. These marriages were to take place at
a fixed season, and all the children born of them within
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 103</span>the year to be regarded the common children of all: here
the word <i>community</i> may fairly apply. He has nowhere
told us whether in successive years the same parents were
to remain united, and hence we do not know whether his
marriages were meant to be temporary or not. I fancy
the point was of little importance to him. If the offspring
turned out well, there would be no change; if badly, of
course the guardians of the State would not sanction the
continuance of an unwholesome union. Thus, though
Plato was willing to allow sentiment its sentimental place,
and to bring forward the decision of the rulers of the State
as the will of Providence, marriages professedly arranged
in heaven were to be permitted only with a strict view to
the improvement of the race.</p>

<p>The objection that such an arrangement would destroy
the sanctity and the influence of the family, and thus abolish
our most powerful engine of early education, was no objection
to Plato. He wished to abolish separate families,
and rescue children from the tyranny, the indulgence, and
incompetence of individual parents, so as to put them
under state discipline. And the State was absolutely
nothing but one huge family, as far as the higher classes
were concerned. To us who live in large kingdoms, who
know that the family gives the law for individuals in ordinary
life, and that schemes of public education cannot
replace it, all systems which abolish the sanctity of the
home are inadmissible.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 64. No point in Plato’s scheme excites more sympathy
nowadays with advanced thinkers than that of equalizing
the sexes in education, and subjecting women to the
same training and duties as men. For he held that, though
nature had not made women as strong as men, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 104</span>their important functions in the production of the race put
them under some inconveniences and disabilities, there
was, nevertheless, no reason to assume any permanent
difference in kind. If such a theory is thought revolutionary
by most people in modern society, what must it
have been in the days and among the people of Plato’s
age! Here, again, what guided him was an exaggerated
estimate of the liberty and importance of Spartan women,
who, when young, were encouraged to exercise in public;
and who, when married, maintained over their husbands an
influence far exceeding that of women in other Greek
households. But then we must not forget the small culture
of the men, their devotion to military training, and the
consequent necessity for women to use their own judgment
in the management of their homes.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 65. On the other hand, if we may digress for a moment
on account of the interest and importance of the
subject, there is no valid reason why the physical production
of the race should not receive infinitely more attention
than it does within the bounds of our present social arrangements.
In the first place, though the sentimental
reasons for marrying are still put in the foreground, and
though at wedding speeches and in amatory correspondences
some divine predestination, or the sentimental compulsion
called falling in love, is assumed the only efficient
cause of marriages, we know that many reasonable considerations
intervene and are the real motives of action. These
motives—the acquisition of wealth or position or connection,
the desire of home comforts and of a life independent
of external amusements, a calm mutual respect—are commonly
enough confessed even by the very people who parade
sentimental reasons; and whenever a marriage appears
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 105</span>suitable from rational considerations, no trouble is spared
by match-makers to induce young people to imagine themselves
drawn together by some subtle and sentimental affinity—like
Plato’s guardians, who were to pretend the
providential lot as their guide.</p>

<p>If, then, such be the case; if even now there are civilized
countries and classes of people who openly profess
prudential reasons as the best for marrying, it will only require
a better education of public opinion to enable men to
advance to the position that the physical and mental vigor
of the resulting children is a motive to be consciously considered
in the selection. We may first reach the stage of
avoiding an hereditary taint as people now fly an infectious
disease. Such avoidance would ultimately stamp out or reduce
to a minimum this evil, and the race would escape a
great part of the direst and most hopeless of its physical
miseries. Then the systematic and deliberate desire that
there should be healthy children will discover many conditions
now unknown, when so many of our unions are the
result of chance or avarice, or, still worse, of passion. Men
of science will begin to make observations on the difference
of physical antecedents which cause such curious differences
in children of the same house. And the day will
come when, from a body of such observations, valuable
practical rules may be deduced. We may thus improve
our race as the Spartans did in old Greece; and they, we
know, were perfectly successful in obtaining what they
sought—a high average of physical strength and beauty.</p>

<p>All this, we may hope, will only be the introduction to
a far more important, but far more difficult, problem—the
determining of the conditions which produce genius. There
is no reason to doubt that these conditions are mainly transient,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 106</span>for genius is no fixed heritage, the most splendid
instances coming from obscure and ordinary parents. Nor
does the mere combination of the suitable parents work its
effect uniformly without other more limited conditions. For
we find the great leaders of the world sometimes the only
child, sometimes eldest, sometimes youngest, or in the middle
of a family of brothers and sisters as obscure as their
parents. The careful observation, then, not only of the
parents, but of the particular passage in their life which
produced an intellectually splendid offspring, is one upon
which we cannot expect light for a long time, and until
people have become accustomed to regard the general improvement
of the race of far greater importance than they
now do. If such results could be obtained even approximately—if,
even in one case out of ten, intellectual excellence
could be produced as we reproduce physical perfections—then,
indeed, the perfectibility of mankind would no
longer be a vague dream, but would show some signs of a
partial fulfilment.</p>

<p>Are we to hope that such an advance in ideas will take
place in our own day? We have perhaps advanced beyond
the stage when men regard genius as distinctly
heaven-born, and the direct gift of the gods, apart from any
natural conditions. If it is indeed heaven-born, it is now
conceded to be such through the combination of natural
causes. But, on the other hand, our best and most refined
people will recoil with deep aversion from making a scientific
analysis of such conditions; they will exclaim that the
possible advantages are as nothing compared with the desecration
of that mystery which has been hallowed by the
sacraments of the Church, and protected from profane inquiry
by a cloud of delicate sentiment. To reduce the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 107</span>holy estate of marriage to the deliberate and scientific production
of conditioned offspring will destroy, say they, all
the sanctity of the relation, and with it the purity and dignity
of our homes.</p>

<p>These weighty and respectable objections are to be met
by observing that it would be idle and wrong to attempt
any reform in opposition to the unanimous sentiment of
the very people who alone could carry it out—our most
sober and refined classes. Until this sentiment can
be gradually changed by argument, and come to be looked on as a
venerable and amiable superstition, nothing will be accomplished.
But it is a matter of history that the most respectable
and hallowed sentiments, if irrational, can be
gradually removed by a progress in what Mr. Lecky calls
<i>rationalism</i>, or intellectual enlightenment. We can even
now point to the important fact, that in those countries
and those ages where marriages had been confessedly arranged
from prudential reasons, they have not been less
sacred, nor has home life been less pure, than where vague
and irrational sentiments have been brought into the foreground.
The lower-class Irish are as faithful and happy in
their homes, and the marriage-tie is a sacred and honored
as it is anywhere in the world; and yet among them a love-match
is rare. It is a matter of cows and of pigs, of the
succession to a farm—nay, often of arrangement by the
landlord for reasons of his own; and yet these marriages
are as happy and as pure as if they had been the outcome
of a great mutual passion. The same thing may be said
of married life in the country parts of France, where a
thrifty and provident race accommodate their unions to
their circumstances, and leave the extravagances of great
passion to poets and Parisians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 108</span>The history of Greece offers a more notable instance. If
we ask where in Greece the home enjoyed the greatest
honor and sanctity, where the house-mother stood highest
in reverence and social importance, and where violations
of fidelity were rarest, no one would hesitate to answer, At
Sparta. Yet at Sparta all the sentiment, all the delicacy,
of the marriage-tie was sacrificed to the duty of producing
healthy children for the State. Plutarch tells us of a state
of things which modern people would think wholly subversive
of all purity—of old men ceding their rights of
temporary unions and exchanges for the sake of desirable
offspring. The Spartan men and women were not
wanting in sentiment about marriage, in advocating the
honor and sanctity of the marriage-tie; but their sentiment
led them to regard a fine offspring as the noblest outcome
of marriage, and one to which all other considerations were
secondary. Hence it was in accordance with their sentiment
that they adopted the same kind of precautions as
regards physical perfection which a later and wiser age
may adopt as regards intellectual and moral perfection.</p>

<p>This possibility of improving intellect by careful selection
was beyond Plato’s vision; he only thought of physical
qualities in the arrangement of his unions. But it is
one of the most remarkable points in his exclusive and aristocratic
society that he makes provision for the adopting of
any particularly bright child of the operative class among
his guardians, so that they might benefit by the accident.
The degradation of poor or unhealthy children of the
higher class is also contemplated.</p>

<p>His arrangement of the years of education is as follows:
It is divided into three parts. Beginning with the learning
of proper myths and tales, it proceeds to easy gymnastic,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 109</span>followed by music and poetry, with reading, writing, arithmetic,
and some elementary mathematics, all of which occupy
from the seventh to the eighteenth year, and thus correspond
to our schooling. Then comes military training up
to the twentieth year—a division to which we, who have
no conscription, have no analogy, as the Germans have.
Next follows the second division of higher studies in pure
and applied mathematics for ten years, and the third in
metaphysic for five years. These are, of course, quite wide
of any practical scheme, and are intended to form those
philosophic rulers who will regard their whole life here as
a preparation for a higher sphere.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 66. His views on the details of music and gymnastic
were not materially different from those of the practical
educators which we have discussed, save that he proposes
to train his guardian class with more detail and circumstance
than were possible for any ordinary public.</p>

<p>He is unpractical, and even absurd, in his curious prudery
about the tales and legends which children are to
learn. He objects to Homer, to the tragedies, still more
to the comedies, and, no doubt, to the folk-lore of the day,
as inculcating base and immoral views of the gods and
their relations to men. Fairy tales are always to represent
God as one and as perfectly good. He even goes so far—but
here he can hardly be in earnest—as to recommend
that children shall learn by heart his laws instead of poetry
and myths!<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Throughout all his remarks on this subject,
he evidently ignores the culture of the imagination as such,
which we recognize as so important that we even tolerate
or overlook immoralities or manifest fictions in aiming at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 110</span>this kind of amusement and culture of children. Indeed,
it is certain that when children are taught fairy tales <em>as
such</em>, the immoral acts of real life, such as robbery and
murder, are only accessories to the imaginary life, in which
there is generally some rude justice.</p>

<p>Even apart from this particular question, we find all
through Plato’s theory of education a very mischievous dislike
of any liberty of opinion, or liberty of life, in the youth
of his State. He goes so far in the “Laws” as to make
heresy of opinion penal, and to punish with imprisonment
those who will not conform to the doctrines of the lawgiver.
If there be anything which would tempt us to reject
the “Laws,” as not the genuine work of Socrates’ disciple,
it is this strange narrowness of view, which makes Grote
argue that the actual Athens of Plato’s day was superior
to the ideal he constructed. But doctrinaires of all ages
hate human liberty. Nor do the Greeks ever seem to have
been forced by the pressure of circumstances to mark off
the close of formal education by a fixed period, like our
graduation at a university, when the young man is expected
to strike out into the world and henceforth educate himself
in practical life.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 67. The educational book of Aristotle’s “Politics”
(<abbr title="7">VII.</abbr> in the now received order) is a mere fragment, which
suggests many problems, and solves but few. Even with
the help of some important corrections from the “Ethics,”
we find it the narrow and old-fashioned scheme of a pedant
Greek, written with admiration for the artificial discipline
of Sparta, and unable to understand even the far more
splendid Hellenic ideal sketched by Thucydides in his
speech of Pericles. We know, however, from the “Ethics”
that he felt the essential importance of family ties between
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 111</span>husband and wife, between parents and children. Hence
he rejects Plato’s proposal of abolishing the family, and
insists that the ideal State must consist of households in
the strict sense. But, on the other hand, he quite agrees
with Plato’s view that the social and moral aspects of marriage
are by no means inconsistent with a strict supervision
of the producing of healthy children by the State. He
foreshadowed the state of things anticipated above, when
husband and wife will still feel the deep sanctity and thorough
loyalty of their relation, and yet not leave to mere
accident the most important product, nay, the only product,
so far as the State is concerned, of their union. He is
just as careful as Plato in recommending care of unborn
children by attention to their mothers’ air and exercise.
He is still more ruthless in advocating the destruction,
either before or after birth, of illegitimate offspring. Neither
can he, any more than Plato, imagine an ideal state
capable of such expansion as to contain a great people,
nor can he dispense with disabilities for most of its members,
such as slaves and operatives.</p>

<p>He does not contemplate the very long and elaborate
after-training of Plato’s guardians, for he does not conceive
this world as a preparation for another, but as an end
in itself. And it is probably for this reason that he is so
superior to Plato in analyzing the function of refined
recreation, and the ennoblement of leisure by æsthetic
pleasures. Thus he sees that music is to be utilized as a
recreation for youth, as well as for a moral engine of education.
He has explained in his “Poetic” that dramatic
poetry is not mere fiction, to be banished from the ideal
State as teaching falsehood or depicting crime, but a representation
of human life deeper and more philosophic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 112</span>than history, inasmuch as history only widens the intellect,
while the drama also purifies the emotions of the spectator.
It may even be argued that history widens the intellect
only so far as it is conceived as a drama—a development
of human character—and not as a mere recitation of
facts.</p>

<p>While he does not enounce so clearly as Plato that
gymnastics are mainly a training for the character, he sets
his face against that physical training which studies nothing
but the development of muscle, on the ground that,
if at all excessive, it defeats its own object by engendering
an unhealthy state; and that, as we cannot work the body
and the mind together with any severity, it must generally
coincide with ignorance or with an illiterate life. Even
the Spartan military training, which was opposed by them
to athletic training, falls under his censure.</p>

<p>He will not concede, with Plato, the equality in kind of
the sexes, but thinks the functions of women are distinct
in kind from those of men, and therefore not to be perfected
by adopting the same training. Thus he is, on the
whole, tamer and more conservative, but also less suggestive,
than his great master.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 68. The main value of his fragment on education is
that it shows how thoroughly the subject had been discussed
in his day. Thus, after determining that the civic side of
the citizen is all-important, and that, therefore, all education
must be public and the same for all, as in Sparta, he
proceeds thus with his argument:<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> “What, then, is education,
and how are we to educate? For there is as yet no
agreement on the point; all men are not of the same
opinion as to what the young should learn either with a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 113</span>view to perfection or to the best life; nor is it agreed
whether education is to aim at the development of the intellect
or the moral character. Nay, more; from the ordinary
standpoint the matter is quite confused, and it is
not clear to anybody whether we are to train in what
leads to virtue, in what is useful for ordinary life, or in
abstract science. All these alternatives have their advocates.
Again, as regards what leads to virtue, there is no
general consent, for since men do not agree in what they
honor as such, of course they cannot agree about the training
to obtain it. As regards what is useful for life, it is
obvious that there are certain indispensable things which
must be taught, and it is equally clear that there are others
which must not. All occupations are divided into those
which a free man should practise and those which he
should not, and, therefore, this affords us a limitation in
the learning of useful arts.” He goes on to show that no
trade is gentlemanly if it injuriously affects the body, or
enslaves the mind by being practised for hire. Even the
fine arts, if studied in this way, or professionally, are to
him an unworthy occupation, and are only to be pursued
in youth as a recreation or æsthetic training; so that in
middle life men may be competent judges of such productions,
and either better able to enjoy them (as in music),
or less likely to be deceived (as in the purchase of works
of art). Having applied these principles to athletics,
about which he says little save in recommendation of moderation,
and against any professional training, he turns to
the question of music, on which we have already given the
views which he held in common with the most serious
Greek educators. On this subject, too, there was controversy.
He has before him three theories: is it mere <em>amusement</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 114</span>(<span title="paidia" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παιδία</span>), or an engine of <em>education</em> (<span title="paideia" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παιδεία</span>), or an
æsthetic <em>pleasure</em> (<span title="diagôgê" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διαγωγή</span>)?<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Perhaps we have dwelt too
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 115</span>long on these theories, but it seemed desirable to give the
reader the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">locus classicus</i> on the Hellenic theory of music,
which was discussed above (<a href="#sect43">§ 43</a>), and which, in spite of
all our studies of Greek life, is still quite strange and incredible
to modern theorists in education.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 69. There is yet another scheme of education left us
by the classical age of Greece, Xenophon’s “Education of
Cyrus,” which, in the form of a very tedious novel on the
life of the Persian king, gives a theory of the education of
a prince and his surroundings which may deserve a very
few words in concluding this chapter.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> He shares with
Plato and Aristotle the belief that private education, with
mere prohibitive laws to guide the citizen, is quite insufficient.
All the theorists were agreed that there must be
one public education, and they imagined that crime would
be to a great extent precluded by such effective training.</p>

<p>Xenophon, dividing his period of education into boyhood
up to sixteen, and <em>youth</em> (<span title="ephêbeia" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐφηβεία</span>) up to twenty-six,
provides a regular public-school education for the boys,
keeping them all together in a sort of polity of their own,
where their teaching is performed by special State masters,
and their quarrels and delinquencies settled by tribunals of
their own. To the elder youth is assigned all the police
and patrol duty, as well as the accompanying of the king
in hunting, especially of beasts of prey. This sort of exercise
Xenophon had learned to know in the East, and he
recognized its superiority over ordinary gymnastics. But
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 116</span>the musical education, on which Plato and Aristotle lay
such stress, he omits altogether, without giving his reasons.
Perhaps he found from experience that the great Aryan
nobles were men of refinement, and understood the harmony
of life no less than the more theoretical Greeks. He
also differs from them in alone recognizing the importance
of a system which will control not one limited city, but an
empire of various peoples and languages. Yet his education
is, in consequence, only the expensive and exclusive
training of a dominant aristocracy, and is not supposed to be
compulsory for the ordinary citizen. In his State all higher
official position is only to be attained by this training.</p>

<p>There are no other ideas in the scheme which make it
worthy of any special consideration. The Spartan system
blinded the vision of all these speculators, and kept them
from understanding the true character of a free and various
development of individual genius.</p>

never recommended exposal, but only a relegation of the children of
unhealthy parents into his third grade of society. In the “Laws”
(if it be, indeed, his work) he lets the whole matter drop, though it
was to be expected that he should discuss it. Whether this arose
from a gradual advance of humanity in Plato himself, or from the
adverse criticism of the day, we cannot tell. The German critics
(Zeller, Susemihl, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>) hold the former; I am disposed to the latter,

<span class="fs75">THE GROWTH OF SYSTEMATIC HIGHER EDUCATION.—UNIVERSITY LIFE AT ATHENS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="sp1">§ 70. It has been stated in the foregoing chapters that
during the earlier or strictly classical period the Greeks
never thought of endowing or regulating higher education.
The careful system of training at Sparta, promoted and controlled
by the State, hardly included even primary education.
The police regulations alluded to at Athens only concerned
details of management in private schools, and only primary
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 117</span>schools, which were worked by masters self-appointed and
supported by the demand for them or their popularity in
their district. Nowhere do we find anything approaching
to a State endowment or regulation of university education.
In fact, the want of such higher education was only felt
when the Greek mind began to turn inwards upon itself
after its extraordinary expansion in the Persian wars. And
then the first want was supplied by voluntary efforts—by
the Sophists who wandered from town to town, citizens of
no fixed State, teachers in complete independence of all State
direction. Indeed, their avoidance of political duties and
responsibilities often brought them into suspicion, oftener
into contempt.</p>

<p>Socrates and Plato brought against them two other objections—the
one serious and capital, the other trivial and
absurd; and yet it was the latter which told with the public.
The former objection was that of superficiality and
boastful assumption; they professed, within a short time, to
teach all that was needful in science and literature, in philosophy
and politics. And here the deeper thinking of professed
philosophers superseded them, though they had not
been either useless or contemptible in their day. The second
objection reminds us strongly of the prejudice once
felt against taking interest for money—all such profit being
regarded as usury in the worst sense of the term. It
was urged that the Sophists asked and received pay for
spreading the truth, and for teaching what every honest
man ought to communicate (if he were able) for nothing.
But although it was all very well for the eccentric and exceptional
Socrates, for the wealthy Plato, to refuse all remuneration,
the theory that the Sophist was not a laborer
worthy of his hire asserted that all higher education must
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 118</span>be carried on by amateurs, and thus tended to destroy all
systematic and widely diffused culture.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 71. This narrow prejudice, therefore, did not resist
the common-sense of the public when brought to bear
upon it. We are assured that Plato, like Socrates, took no
payment. Our authorities are silent about Aristotle, and
it is hence inferred that he followed the same rule. But
Speusippus, his successor in the school, is said to have demanded
regular fees. This had been the practice with all
the rhetoricians who taught young men after their emancipation
from school, and who followed the natural precedent
of the Sophists. Such a practice was all the more
reasonable, as the pupils in philosophical schools, even in
Plato’s, were divided into amateur pupils, who came for
mere general training, and professional students, who meant
to take up teaching for their livelihood, and who spent a
long time in special studies. Thus pupils’ fees were always
a possible, and became an actual, endowment for
higher teaching. In the Sophists’ days men complained
that these fees were exorbitant, though perhaps not with
justice. In later days we hear of large fees from rich pupils,
but always as voluntary donations, and for the purpose
of relieving poorer fellow-students. For the schools of
philosophy began to be secured from difficulties by a second
means of endowment—the donations of patrons and
the bequests of pious founders. As regards these donations
by rich pupils, we hear from Philostratus<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> that a rich
scholar, Damianus, gave to each of the Sophists Aristeides
and Adrianos 10,000 drachmæ, to supply poor students
with free lectures. This gift, about £400 of our money,
represents a far larger sum in relation to the then existing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 119</span>conditions of wealth. One hundred drachmæ were probably
considered an adequate fee for a complete course;
and if it be true that a popular teacher could often command
one hundred pupils, even though the course occupied
more than one year, the endowment was considerable.</p>

<p>The desire of procuring free education for poorer lads
with literary tastes is, however, an interesting and permanent
feature in the Greek mind. At the present moment
the University of Athens provides free education for every
Greek, and is wholly supported by a State subsidy. This
now unique provision brings to Athens an influx of young
Greeks from all the Levant, from Turkish countries, from
Egypt—nay, even from Italy. They support themselves as
best they can, often by menial employments, provided they
can keep their lecture hours free. Lodging together in the
humblest apartments, they club their scanty earnings for
the purchase of a light and a text-book, which they use in
common, the one sleeping till his fellow has done his work,
and wakes him to hand him the fresh-trimmed lamp and
well-worn manual.</p>

<p>This state of things, which reminds us so strongly of
the mediæval universities, and is inestimably honorable to
a growing age of culture when the masses want leavening,
may be driven to a dangerous excess when the educated
classes become too numerous; for it dissuades every ambitious
young man from agriculture and the commercial
pursuits so necessary to a nation’s welfare. And as this is
the case in Greece now, so it was doubtless the case when,
in the days of Hellenism, Athens offered philosophy at so
cheap a rate to all the Greek-speaking world. The class of
learned idlers who would not pursue any mercantile calling
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 120</span>increased throughout Greece.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Although, therefore,
the condition of things at Oxford and Cambridge—which,
in addition to their vast endowments, demands a heavy
outlay from their alumni—is not to be defended, there is an
opposite error, and one likely to do more mischief: it is
the setting-up of the lower classes to seek university degrees
with a minimum of expense and trouble, and consequently
a minimum of culture. This mistaken course,
which now threatens the Irish people, in addition to all
their other misfortunes, tends strongly to increase (as is
the case in modern Greece) a dangerous class of social and
political malcontents, who consider that their high education
is not recognized, and that they have no scope for
their literary or political talents.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p class="sp1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 121</span>§ 72. We turn to the endowments by bequest, which
were the direct cause of the establishment of philosophical
schools at Athens. This idea seems due to Plato, who acquired
for his school a local habitation as well as a name.
It is well known that from early times there were two gymnasia
(in the Greek sense) provided for the youth who had
finished their schooling—that in the groves of the suburb
called after the hero Academus, and that called the Kynosarges,
near Mount Lycabettus. The latter was specially
open to the sons of citizens by foreign wives. Thirdly, in
Pericles’ day was established the <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">Lykeion</i>, near the river
Ilisos. They were all provided with water, shady walks
and gardens, and were once among the main beauties of
Athens and its neighborhood.</p>

<p>The Academy became so identified with Plato’s teaching
that his pupils Antisthenes (the Cynic) and Aristotle
settled beside or in the Kynosarges and Lykeion respectively,
and were known by their locality till the pupils of
Antisthenes removed to the frescoed portico (<i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">stoa</i>) in
Athens, and were thence called Stoics. Epicurus taught
in his own garden in Athens. All these settlements were
copied from Plato’s idea. He apparently taught both in
the public gymnasium and in a private possession close
beside it; and in his will, preserved by Diogenes Laertius,
he bequeaths his two pieces of land to Speusippus, thus
designating him as his formal successor. His practice being
followed, the title <i>scholarch</i> soon grew up for the head of
the school, and the owner of a life interest in the <span title="diatribê" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διατριβή</span>
or locality devoted to the purpose. Each master was called
the <i>successor</i> (<span title="diadochos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διάδοχος</span>) of his predecessor, and the succession
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 122</span>of these heads of schools has been traced with more
or less success all through the Hellenistic period.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 73. This is, no doubt, the cause of the fixed and traditional
character of the philosophical schools at Athens, and
one main reason why this city became in the Roman Empire,
when original research had died out, the principal
university of the old world. The successive scholarchs
seem to have thought of nothing but the repeating and expounding
of the founder’s views; and it is mentioned as a
special loss to the Peripatetic school that Aristotle’s works
were left away from the school, and travelled into the possession
of Neleus to Scepsis in the Troad. Hence the
scholarchs, instead of developing a new doctrine, were
simply helpless, and only taught what they could remember,
or what had been preserved by fragments in the note-books
of the school. The proper investment of the school
property was also the scholarch’s duty, and we hear that in
the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, under Proclus, the Platonic endowment
was worth more than one thousand pieces of gold annually.
Suidas tells us<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> “that from time to time pious patrons
of learning bequeathed in their wills to the adherents
of the school the means of living a life of philosophic
leisure.” This is very analogous to the bequests of pious
founders in the Middle Ages, especially of those who had
the far-seeing wisdom to free their endowments from the
penalty of teaching—a humane and enlightened intention,
now frustrated by the rage for turning universities into
mere training establishments.</p>

<p>The designating of a successor by will, or shortly before
the scholarch’s death, became the rule in the principal
schools of rhetoric, except that at Athens election by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 123</span>school came to take its place. So far as we know, this
was first suggested by Lycon, Aristotle’s third successor, if
not by Theophrastus. But the will of Lycon, preserved by
Diogenes, is express: “I bequeath the <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">peripatos</i> to my pupils
Bulon, Kallinos, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>, without condition. Let them appoint
whomsoever they think will be most zealous and best
keep together the school. May the rest of the school
stand by him, for my sake and that of the place.” These
words not only imply that there was a staff of assistants,
selected from favorite pupils who intended to make philosophy
their profession, but is peculiarly interesting as
naturally suggesting a competitive examination, without
naming it, as the method of choice. In Lucian’s “Eunuch,”
the appointment is described as an election by votes of the
chief men, after an examination of the candidate in his
knowledge of, and faith in, the system. There were cases
when the electing body was not the school, but the Areopagus,
or the council; for the hatred and jealousy of the
schools made an election from without safer. When the
chief literary posts at Athens became salaried by the State,
such interference was natural, and disputed elections were
even referred to the emperor at Rome.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 74. Eunapius tells us of an interesting dispute of this
kind for the office of Sophist (the highest literary post at
Athens) on the death of Julianus, 340 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, and its consequent
vacation. Six candidates—four of them pupils of
Julianus, and two other needy persons—were selected by
common consent; the Roman proconsul was president
of the electing court, and so violent was the canvassing
that he was obliged to interfere and order people out of
Athens. The candidates handed in essays and made set
speeches. There were <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">claqueurs</i> ready with their prepared
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 124</span>applause. Then the proconsul again cited them, and gave
them a theme for an extempore speech. Five refused, saying
they were not accustomed to pour out, but to think out,
their orations. Prohæresius, a pupil of Julianus, alone
took up the challenge, and, all applause being interdicted,
maintained his reputation splendidly. Nevertheless, he did
not then obtain the chair; for his opponents secured influential
electors with dinners and presents, and, no doubt,
the social talents of a Sophist in this chair were very important.
They took shameful ways of succeeding; “but,
indeed,” says Eunapius, “you can hardly blame them for
working their case as best they could.”</p>

<p>This interesting story belongs to later days, when the
chairs of philosophy and rhetoric at Athens came under
State support and control. In early days, up to the Christian
era, the schools were perfectly private, free, and independent
of the State. We hear, indeed, of such decrees as
that of the Thirty Tyrants forbidding rhetoric and philosophy
to be taught. But though any ancient state, even a
free democracy, would have thought itself quite justified in
such interference for public reasons, there is no definite attempt
at such a policy till the days of Theophrastus, when
(about 316 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) Sophocles, son of Amphicleides of Sunium,
passed a law that no one should open a school of
philosophy without the approval of the senate and people.
There was a formal exodus of philosophic students, who
only returned with Theophrastus, when Sophocles was convicted
under the <i>law against illegal procedure</i> (<span title="graphê paranomôn" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γραφὴ παρανόμων</span>),
and his law repealed. This attempt of Sophocles
might have been defended from Plato’s “Republic” and
“Laws,” where the philosopher distinctly recommends State
control of education. But it was, no doubt, the antidemocratic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 125</span>tone of the schools, especially of the Platonic school,
which prompted this action, for we hear that Demosthenes’
nephew, Demochares, and other democratic leaders, supported
Sophocles, on the special ground that Plato’s school
had supplied most of the later tyrants to Greece.</p>

<p>The true way of controlling education had not yet dawned
upon the public men of Athens—the endowing of chairs,
with a power of removal. We hear, indeed, gradually of
small salaries for <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">sophronistæ</i> and other guardians of youth,
but direct State patronage of teachers first meets us among
the Egyptian and Pergamene successors of Alexander.
Then the Roman emperors, as we shall presently see, appointed
regular professors. But all this took the form of
honoring a great teacher, as states honored him with civic
freedom, immunity from taxes, bronze statues, and the like.
His special teaching was not criticised or directed from
without.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 75. The time came, however, when more than formal
or irregular honors were paid to the teaching profession.
The Roman emperors established chairs (<span title="thronoi" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θρόνοι</span>) of theoretical
and practical rhetoric, and of the four sects of philosophy,
the former of which they endowed with 10,000
drachmæ per annum each. The highest chair was entitled
the Sophist’s chair, that term having, after all, maintained
its old respectability, and recovered from the obloquy
thrown upon it by Socrates and Plato. There was even a
subdivision of the Sophist’s chair, a second chair being
called the <em>political</em> chair. These appointments seem to
have been the device of Hadrian, though L. Egnatius Lollianus
of Ephesus was the first salaried occupant of the chair,
and was appointed under Antoninus Pius. The same policy,
carried out by Marcus Aurelius, gave immunity from taxes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 126</span>and civic duties to all the learned professions—physicians,
philosophers, rhetoricians, and grammarians. Then the
term <span title="dêmosieuein" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δημοσιεύειν</span> (<i>to be a public servant</i>), once applied to a
public hangman or a dispensary doctor, now came to mean
a public and salaried professor.</p>

<p>The salaries were paid in kind—five Roman modii of
wheat per month—and were thus free from the great fluctuations
in money values common in those days. The pupils’
fees were paid in money, and were due on January 1;
but we hear many complaints of irregularity in this respect.
This was mainly caused by the ambition of the
rival teachers to have their class-rooms filled, and hence
their indulgence in the case of the poor and the procrastinating,
who could not or would not pay, and were nevertheless
permitted to continue their studies. One hundred
drachmæ paid down seem to have been thought an average
fee; but great variations were allowed, and there was evidently
no tariff, or any such credentials as our parchments
to show that a man had attended his course, paid his fees
regularly, and obtained what we call a degree. Libanius
mentions an amusing case of a man sending with his son
to Athens a donkey, by the sale of which the fees were to
be paid. No doubt, the profits made by the greater chairs
were considerable, and the <i>sophist</i> and <i>rhetor</i>, with their
higher colleagues, represented Athens on state occasions
as civic dignitaries. They were expected to go out to meet
any very distinguished visitor, and address him with complimentary
harangues; they had to present themselves officially
every month to the proconsul at Corinth, presumably
to report on the state of Athens. We hear that they
obtained leave of absence only by special permission and
with difficulty. In contrast to this importance and splendor,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 127</span>we have a pitiable account in Libanius of the miseries
of the rhetors at Antioch, who strove to keep up a respectable
appearance while they were persecuted with duns and
creditors, and almost starved at home.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 76. A great deal of obscurity still remains, not only
concerning the exact number of salaried professors of
sophistic and rhetoric, but concerning their relations to
the crowd of assistants, recognized and unrecognized, which
must have existed at the University of Athens. So clear
was the policy of Hadrian, and still more of M. Aurelius,
to make it the main seat of the world’s learning, that all
manner of students went thither to enjoy the various privileges
offered. The grand man, the <i>Sophist</i>, could not be
expected to do tutor’s or coaching work; and as many lads
came from the far East and West with little training, there
must have been a considerable class of private teachers to
help them on. This was also done by the lad’s <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">pædagogue</i>,
who came with him from home. But there appears to
have been a licensed class of secondary professors, the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Privat-Docenten</i>
of the Germans, who enjoyed no salary, but
lived on the fees of pupils. It is not likely that the total
number of these licensed lecturers in sophistic and rhetoric
exceeded eight or ten; the private tutors were probably
very numerous.</p>

<p>We naturally inquire how this State appointment to professorial
chairs was consistent with the succession already
described in the four philosophical schools. In these there
was no formal change; they were elected by a committee
of recognized heads of each school. But gradually the influence
of the emperor made itself felt. The procurator,
who came from Corinth to look after such matters, either
influenced the nomination of the committee, or <em>recommended</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 128</span>the election of a particular candidate. Even in the case
of the public chairs there was sometimes a competition,
and often the emperor did not interfere with his lieutenant’s
arrangements. Herodes Atticus was almost omnipotent in
his day in these appointments. Dismissals from the public
chairs were very unusual, but distinctly asserted as the
emperor’s right. The Prohæresius above mentioned was
dismissed by the Emperor Julian, because he appeared to be
a Christian.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 77. It is more interesting to turn to the peculiarities
of life which bound together the young men at the University
of Athens, and the various customs which then, as
now, gave a peculiar tone to the student’s life. What is
called the <em>atmosphere</em> of Oxford or Cambridge, of Dublin
or Harvard, consists in a body of traditional customs maintained
by the peculiar conservatism of youth, which moulds
every new-comer, and produces a certain type of character,
and even a certain fixity of manners. It seems probable
that the earliest Italian universities in the Middle Ages,
which go back to the eleventh or twelfth century, acquired
some of these traditions from the Greek universities of the
decadence, and thus a direct filiation may be traced between
the customs now to be described, as existing at Athens in
the Hellenistic period, and those of modern Europe. But
to investigate this obscure subject thoroughly would lead
us far beyond our present limits.</p>

<p>We hear that no one was allowed to attend lectures, at
least in the fourth century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, without dressing in the
scholar’s short <em>cloak</em> (<span title="tribôn" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρίβων</span>)—in fact, our college gown;
and the right of wearing it was only obtained by leave of
the Sophist. This in itself was a mark probably more
universal than the gowns at Oxford and Cambridge, for we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 129</span>have no evidence that Greek gentlemen, like the modern
English, hated all official costumes.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>There was no arrangement for a daily commons of students;
there were no college buildings, and the students
lodged where they could, as they do in the foreign universities,
such as Göttingen or Leyden. But there were special
dining societies in each of the four philosophic schools,
meeting once a month or oftener, for which funds were
bequeathed, and which were regarded as a special bond of
union. Of course, simple fare and philosophical conversation
was the original plan: it degenerated into luxury and
sumptuous feasting; for the dinners given by Lycon, when
head of the Peripatetic school, lasted till the following
morning. He entertained twenty at a time for the nominal
fee of nine obols, which was even remitted to poor
scholars. This took place on the last day of the month.
Epicurus, in his will, made special provision for a feast
every twentieth of the month. The Stoics had three such
clubs, called after scholarchs who probably were the founders.
The intention of these feasts, which were more like
Oxford <em>gaudies</em> than ordinary commons, was to bring masters
and pupils into closer relation, and this is found a true
plan in all modern society. People seldom become intimate
who do not dine together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 130</span>At Athens, too, there was no official tutorial discipline;<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
there were no compulsory chapels, or lectures, or fines; and
order seems to have been kept by the very republican arrangement
of a senior prefect (<span title="archôn" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄρχων</span>), elected by the class
every ten days. We are told that the professor, besides
remonstrance, sometimes struck idle or stupid scholars;
and Libanius talks of being “sent down” as a terrible disgrace,
involving serious consequences to the lad’s parents,
and even to his native town. Perhaps it may correspond
to expulsion from our universities; but this must have
been for the gravest crimes only. The pupils of any professor
were merely known as his <i>circle</i> (<span title="hoi apo" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἱ ἀπό</span>, or <span title="peri" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περί</span>, <span title="tinos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τινος</span>);
they were only his pupils or hearers in that they attended
his lectures. Indeed, they often designated him by a
nickname public enough to have been transmitted in after-literature.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 78. We find an unusual variety of terms,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> all transferred
from other combinations, to express the clubs or
unions of students among themselves, and they are constantly
mentioned in books and inscriptions of the second
and third centuries <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> They naturally grew out of the
old separation of the ephebi into a separate class long before
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 131</span>university education was organized, or rather crystallized,
into the shape we are now discussing. The presidents
of these clubs were called <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">choregi</i> (also <span title="koryphaioi" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κορυφαῖοι</span> and
<span title="akrômitai" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκρωμῖται</span>). Inscriptions tell us of similar private combinations
among the ephebi in the second century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, in
which names from the general lists are repeated under the
separate heads of <i>Heracleids</i> and <i>Theseids</i>, two associations
to be compared with the students’ clubs at the Italian and
German universities, which often bear the names of nations,
thus pointing to their mediæval origin. There is evidence
of some peculiar importance, possibly of rivalry, as regards
the Theseids and Heracleids at Athens, and the German
critics are probably right in suspecting a political bias to
have been the true ground of difference. The constant relations
of Heracles and Theseus in the legends and the religion
of Attica are well known; the Temple of Theseus,
still standing at Athens, is by many considered a Heracleion,
and the deeds of Heracles are more conspicuously celebrated
than those of Theseus in its sculptured reliefs.
Theseus was certainly raised by Attic legends into the position
of founder of the democracy, and the ideal of an
ephebus, and as such he may have been contrasted to Heracles,
who was the ancestor of Doric nobility, and might
be regarded as of aristocratic tendency. This conjecture
has the merit of probability, though it has no basis beyond
these general grounds.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 79. When we come to later days, especially to the
fourth century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, we hear much about the students’ clubs
from Philostratus, Eunapius, Libanius, and others. It is
remarkable that they were not then formed on the national
basis, as we may conceive the older Heracleids to have been
Bœotian youths, severed from the Attic Theseids, or as we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 132</span>could conceive Irish students associating themselves in an
English university. They were rather suggested by the rivalries
of their teachers, originally of the separate philosophic
schools, but afterwards merely formed on the grounds
of ambition and popularity. A crowded attendance at lectures
was so anxiously desired that every kind of device
was used by the rival professors to induce students to come
to them. This evil became so apparent in its effects upon
the students, who were flattered and courted by their masters,
that Libanius mentions a proposed <i>agreement</i> (<span title="synthêkê" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συνθήκη</span>)
between the professors on the question, which was, however,
unsuccessful. Thus in the older University of Dublin
the profits of college tutors were so great that a similar
rivalry in popularity existed, and the dons are said to have
studied unworthy arts to secure a full chamber. Such canvassing
has almost disappeared since the <i>treaty</i>, as Libanius
calls it, of putting the pupils’ fees into a common fund, of
which the greater part is divided according to the tutor’s
standing, and only a small premium is allowed for the actual
number of pupils.</p>

<p>The constant jealousies and factions occasioned by this
competition among professors were reproduced in the Italian
universities of the Renaissance period; indeed, all
through the Middle Ages. Thus, according to Eunapius,
the president of the club called <span title="Spartê ataktos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σπάρτη ἄτακτος</span> considered
it part of his duty to bring his club in full force, and well
armed, to the Peiræus, or even down to Sunium, in order
to catch students coming from the East, green and fresh,
and secure them for the professor he patronized. Rival
clubs met on these errands, and had pitched battles worse
than those of town and gown in England. Every attempt
was made to secure lads, even before they left their homes.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 133</span>Libanius tells us he came to Athens, having been already
canvassed at his home in Antioch to attend the rhetor Aristodemus,
but was seized by a club in the interest of Diophantus,
and only let free with great difficulty, and after
he had sworn allegiance to Diophantus. We hear of every
sort of violence being committed by these students, in
whose disputes the Roman governor at Corinth was sometimes
obliged to interfere. We hear of their debts and
their poverty, their dissoluteness and idleness. But, of
course, the diligent and orderly minority have left no trace
behind, and we must take care to give no exaggerated
weight to the noisy doings of the baser sort. Even tossing
in a blanket (or carpet) was well known to them,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and
applied to unpopular teachers, probably of the obscurer
sort, as may be seen from Libanius’s oration <cite>On the Carpet</cite>,
in which he lectures them on the subject. We do not
hear of any scholarships, bursaries, or exhibitions intended
to help indigent lads of ability. Indeed, this giving a lad
money rewards for educating himself seems a very evil device
of modern times. To support a student with the bare
necessaries of life, and give him free instruction, is a different
thing, and this was the idea of the pious founders of
scholarships. To repay him in part for an extravagant
preparation by extravagant prizes is a very different notion,
but now so diffused that its absurdity no longer strikes the
public mind in England.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 80. Gregory the Nazianzen tells us of comic ceremonies
by which the freshman was initiated to his studies,
and these practices were technically called <span title="teletai" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τελεταί</span>, or initiatory
rites. These are to be compared to the teasing of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 134</span>beginners known at the German universities under the
name of <i>deposition</i>. At Athens the novice was brought
by a band to the baths through the market-place. Then
those in front began to push him back, and refuse to let
him in, while those behind thrust him forward. After a
rude struggle, probably intended to try his temper, he was
let in, bathed, and thus formally admitted, receiving his
<i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">tribon</i>, or college gown. There was also some unknown
ceremony in the theatre, called <span title="kylistrai" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κυλίστραι</span>, of which the
name only is preserved, from its being forbidden by law in
693 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, and this by a Church synod in Constantinople.
It was identified with other heathen practices and traditions,
and hence considered worthy of being threatened
with excommunication. These late occurrences of student
practices give rise to the suspicion that they may have been
copied in the early school of Bologna. Perhaps the most
curious allusion<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> is to the fact that, after a certain standing,
students were by common consent excused from these follies,
as now in Germany a graduate at Leipzig or Göttingen,
or a professor, would no more think of fighting a student’s
duel than an English gentleman would; while every
younger man is compelled to do so by an iron custom
amounting to the most absolute tyranny.</p>

<p>The example of the Stoics, who taught in the city, was
followed by other schools, after that the successive devastations
of the neighborhood of Athens by Philip <abbr title="5">V.</abbr> of
Macedon (200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), and by Sulla, had injured the gardens
and groves of both Kynosarges, Academy, and Lykeion.
We hear of the <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">Ptolemeion</i> and <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">Diogeneion</i> as the fashionable
places of resort, then Hadrian’s gymnasium—all within
the town, and all the gift of individual founders—the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 135</span>Diogenes in question being a condottiere who commanded
the second King Demetrius’s troops in Attica, 225 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
There is some slight evidence that this man’s gymnasium
was used for beginners, and possibly they may even have
resided there; for we hear that scholars often set up <i>huts</i>
(<span title="kalybia" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καλύβια</span>) near the house of their favorite teachers. There
were libraries in connection with Ptolemy’s and Hadrian’s
gymnasia. Indeed, it seems, in later days, that such was
the danger of a riot if professors lectured in any public
building, that they built private theatres for themselves,
attached to their own houses, and elegantly appointed. In
these we may be sure that their teaching took the form of
a lecture, not of disputation or of catechising. This latter
kind of lesson was very popular in Socrates and Plato’s
time; but Aristotle already severed it from his regular discourses,
and held his philosophic conversations with his
pupils walking in the <i lang="grc-Latn" xml:lang="grc-Latn">Peripatos</i>: hence the title of his
school.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 81. We only know now the names of those professors
who lived for the world and for posterity, and strove to
teach by publishing their works. In an age when originality
was dead, and the highest ability consisted in the best
commentary on Plato and Aristotle, this literary activity,
once admired and praised, seems to us, for the most part,
idle subtlety. Even in rhetoric all the laws and models
were fixed; Longinus only shows us a modern and æsthetic
appreciation of beauty in style, which we do not find in
earlier rhetors. But, of all the scholarchs at Athens, none
are now of the least consideration save the heads of the
Neo-Platonic school; and even these were but followers of
this strange, fascinating doctrine, already preached in Alexandria
and in Rome, which strove to give a new meaning
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 136</span>to the metaphysic of the Academy, and accommodate it
to the spiritual wants of earnest heathen, in the face of
Christianity.</p>

<p>But it is more than probable that, as in our own universities,
so at Athens, the best and most earnest of the teachers
set themselves so exclusively to their task that they
left nothing behind them except in the note-books of their
classes. This sort of university teacher never earns any
wider popularity than that of his college; and yet there,
and among those who have known his diligence, his patience,
and his power, he will always rank far higher than
those who rush before the public from ambition, often
with badly digested ideas. We shall, therefore, do well not
to set down the philosophical teaching at Athens at the
level of those tedious commentaries which the student will
find collected in the later volumes<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> of Mullach’s “Fragmenta
Philosophorum Græcorum.”</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 82. As regards the length of the course which the
students were expected to attend, there are very varying
statements. Five to eight years are mentioned, a period
far too long for young gentlemen like Cicero’s nephews,
and probably only meant to apply to those who went for
professional purposes. There were lads of tender age,
sometimes under the care of a pædagogue, and men of
middle-age, waiting for the chance of a post. There seems
to have been no limit of age, or any compulsion or rule as
to the number of courses to be kept. Every student (or
his parent) was supposed to select for himself what subjects
he should pursue. This was perhaps less mischievous than
it would now be, seeing the quadrivium of humanities was
so fixed by tradition that most students fell into it as a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 137</span>matter of course. Neither was there in old days that multitude
of special subjects, totally unconnected either with
each other or with a liberal education, which now infests
our educational establishments, and causes the hurry after
tangible results to displace the only true outcome of a
higher education—that capacity to think consecutively and
clearly, which is to be acquired by studying a logical and
thoroughly articulated branch of knowledge for the sake of
its accuracy and method.</p>

<p>During most of the flourishing age of Hellenistic culture
the rhetor was the acknowledged practical teacher; and his
course, which occupied several years, with the interruption
of the summer holidays, comprised first a careful reading of
classical authors, both poetical and prose, with explanations
and illustrations. This made the student acquainted with
the language and literature of Greece. But it was only introductory
to the technical study of expression, of eloquence
based on these models, and of accurate writing as a
collateral branch of this study. When a man had so perfected
himself, he was considered fit for public employment.
In the latest times a special knowledge of jurisprudence
became more and more necessary for public servants, and
was provided for by special schools. We have, unfortunately,
no minute description of the precise course of reading
adopted by either Sophists or Rhetors, and are therefore
confined to this general description. But it is, in our
days of hurry and of intellectual compression of subjects,
a remarkable thing to contemplate the youth of the civilized
world spending four or five years in the mere acquiring
of accuracy and elegance of expression after they
had learned at school reading, writing, and the elements of
science.</p>

<p class="sp1"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 138</span>§ 83. In this account of ancient university life our attention
has been almost exclusively confined to Athens,
though there were other seats of education very celebrated,
and in much request—Rhodes, Massilia, Tarsus, and, above
all, Alexandria. Many Roman nobles preferred sending
their sons to Massilia for their education—a Greek town,
planted far away from the vices and luxuries of the East.
Rhodes maintained its political freedom longer than any
other Hellenic settlement, and was famous as a school of
rhetoric. Tarsus, from which we know at least one splendid
specimen of a student—the Apostle Paul—always had
a high and solid reputation for work, and it is very remarkable
how the most serious of all the practical systems, the
Stoic, is identified with that part of Asia Minor. Afterwards
iconoclasm found its cradle there, and thus this land
of serious reforms over and over again forced upon the
world an earnest view of life.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> It is worthy of note how
constantly the great chairs at Athens were filled by men
from these outlying schools; indeed, a native Athenian in
the Sophist’s chair was a great rarity. Yet we know so
little of the inner life of these remote towns that they cannot
now afford us any materials for our inquiry.</p>

<p class="sp1">§ 84. The case is different with Alexandria, concerning
which much has been written and recorded. But, in the
first place, it is hardly correct to speak of education in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 139</span>Alexandria as strictly Hellenic, or even Hellenistic. It was
the meeting-ground of all the faith and dogma of the old
world. The Egyptian, Jewish, and Syrian elements were
so strong there that, considering the absence of all old Hellenic
traditions in this newest of all Greek-speaking towns,
we could hardly use it as a fair specimen of the good and
evil in old Greek training. We may add that up to the
days of the great theological controversies—days so graphically
pictured in Kingsley’s “Hypatia”—we know comparatively
little about the students of Alexandria. All our
information clusters about the teachers. As we might expect,
Alexandria was regarded as the university of progress,
the laboratory of positive science, in contrast to the conservative
and literary Athens. Nevertheless, even all the
sound literary criticism of those days comes from Alexandria.
For it is plain that the Ptolemies intended it not as
a training-place for youth so much as a home for research,
richly endowed with the means and materials for serious
study—first of all, an ample library, then handsome buildings,
retirements, and adequate endowments. These conceptions,
and the success in their execution, are profoundly
interesting in the history of education, but are beyond the
scope of the present work.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_62" href="#FNanchor_62" class="label">[62]</a> The picture of Athens given in the Acts of the Apostles (<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr>
<abbr title="17">xvii.</abbr>) shows that the city was full of people cultivated in philosophy
and letters, but indisposed to pursue any serious calling. They lived
in the agora all day, as in a great club, looking out for gossip and
news. If any one desires to see a modern parallel, I refer him to the
Hall and Library of the Four Courts in Dublin—the most agreeable
place in the world to visit; for there the bar of Ireland, many of
them for want of briefs, occupy themselves with all the scandal of the
day. Nay, even those who are busy refresh themselves, in passing, with
five minutes’ talk, and are never too hurried to enjoy a good story
when it is offered to them. There is even a great deal of real business
done in this desultory and peripatetic way. Whether a new system
of philosophy or a new religion would find a hearing is perhaps
doubtful, and marks the difference between the old Greek and the
modern idler.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_63" href="#FNanchor_63" class="label">[63]</a> Thus, a critic might argue that the present ills of Ireland arise
not only from general idleness and want of thrift, but from melancholy
ignorance of all scientific principles of agriculture, and from a
total misappreciation of the conditions of trading; for here, if anywhere,
honesty is the best policy; but it is not obvious to the ignorant,
especially if they be astute. These evils might be diminished by diffusing
agricultural and commercial schools through the country, not
by granting university degrees for a smattering in arts.</p>

visitors from Spezia or Livorno used to walk about the streets in boating
costume, with their oars over their shoulders, to the admiration of the
Genoese. Imagine the Oxford eight, the day before the University
race, sauntering along Piccadilly in this style! I recommend this
case to the theorists who maintain that human nature is the same at
all times and places.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_66" href="#FNanchor_66" class="label">[66]</a> The description by Libanius of the rhetor’s duty, to receive the
lad from his parents, to advise him, and even to punish him for idleness,
to acquaint the parents periodically of his progress, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>, reminds
us perfectly of the duties of a college tutor. But this was
clearly a voluntary task, and generally undertaken not merely from
duty towards the lad, but from a desire to be popular and to secure a
large following.</p>

<p>A survey of the whole field of the Greek classical literature, including
the prose as well as the poetry, treating in a general way its life
and growth and the mutual relations of its various masterpieces. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
A clear, simple, and accurate statement of general facts and principles,
bringing the whole of the immense subject into one connected
view.—<cite>N. Y. Times.</cite></p>

<p>No other work written upon these subjects in English during the
past twenty years is as valuable as this elaborate compendium. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
It should be found in the library of every scholar and student.—<cite>N. Y.
World.</cite></p>

<p>Among recently published works designed to aid in the attainment
of sound classical scholarship, there have been few that are so well
adapted to their purpose as this. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* To his task he has brought
the qualifications of his own fine and approved scholarship, his practical
knowledge of the exact wants of the class for whom he writes,
and a thorough familiarity with the general literature of the subject.—<cite>N. Y.
Evening Post.</cite></p>

<p>By far the best account of the literature of Greece that has hitherto
appeared in English. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* It is emphatically a good book, a worthy
introduction to the noblest of all literatures, and a grateful boon to
ripe scholars, no less than to the younger students for whom it is expressly
intended. Mr. Mahaffy’s chief merit is the great verve and animation
with which he handles his subject.—<cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>, London.</p>

<p>It is a work of immense learning and practical value. Indeed, it
is a complete hand-book of Greek classical literature, giving the results
of the research and speculations of the best German and French,
as well as English, scholars, and stating his own conclusions with a
modesty which inspires confidence, especially as they are supported
by thorough knowledge of the subject and ample reasons. There is
no work in the English language covering the same ground.—<cite>Evangelist</cite>,
N. Y.</p>

<p>Mr. Symonds has here brought his rich classical learning and excellent
critical taste to the illustration of the Greek poets, forming
an admirable introduction to that branch of ancient literature. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
Apart from the original criticisms and bright descriptive passages
which give an uncommon value and attractiveness to these volumes,
they abound in liberal specimens of translations by different writers,
which form a highly agreeable body of poetry, and present a peculiar
and striking illustration of a department of English literature not
very widely known to general readers.—<cite>N. Y. Tribune.</cite></p>

<p>A book which has scarcely a parallel in recent English literature,
and which will bear comparison with the highest achievements of
German scholarship and criticism. Indeed, the “Studies” may almost
be said to be unique in their combination of wide knowledge
and minute research, with a mastery of the literary art which alone
would suffice to command our warmest admiration. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Our notice
would be incomplete without a cordial word of praise for Professor
Symonds’s spirited and elegant translations of select passages. These
add incalculably to the value and interest of his work.—<cite>Appletons’
Journal</cite>, N. Y.</p>

<p>The great merit of Mr. Symonds’s writings is that, with all their
charm and grace of style, there is real work behind them. It is this,
in combination with other rarer gifts, which makes him so well fitted
to interpret the ancient world to modern readers.—<cite>Academy</cite>, London.</p>

<p>While it is a book readily understood by every thoughtful reader,
it will be of special interest to students who have given much time
to the Greek language and literature. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* We know of no hand-book
of Greek poetry in English as satisfactory—as valuable as this.—<cite>New
Haven Palladium.</cite></p>
